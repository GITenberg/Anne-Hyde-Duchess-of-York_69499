  <h2 class='c010'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Among the records, few at best, left by time of
her who was destined to be the mother of two
queens regnant of England, there is one which
bears its own pathetic significance.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a very small book, only about four inches
long by three wide, bound in stamped leather
from which the gilding is half worn away,
with a broken silver clasp, and thick, stiff
pages.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Additional MSS., 15,900 B. M.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Was this little book a gift from Edward
Hyde to the young daughter whom he dearly
loved? Who is to tell us now?</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a girl’s tiny notebook, a treasure perhaps
to her, in which she writes down occasional
memoranda as they occur to her, but as we turn
the leaves it seems to bridge with a familiar
touch the centuries which lie between us and
that vanished time. There is a page of figures,
a little poetry (“The Contented Marter”), a
list of household matters, “3 bras candlesticks,
4 bras kittles, driping pans,” and so on. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>allusion to a servant—“Betty came to my
Mother”—is on another leaf.</p>

<p class='c012'>One fancies, somehow, that Anne kept this
book by her bedside, jealously clasped, along with
her little store of devotional reading. She filled
it full of writing in pencil, quite easy to decipher,
save that time has made it pale and dim.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some of the sentences are in the French she
came to know very perfectly in later days, and
speak of a long dead romance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Je n’en vey mourir d’amour, mais ce n’est
pas pour un infidèle comme vous.—<span class='sc'>Anne
Hyde.</span>”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Adieu pour jamais, mais n’oubliez pas la
plus misérable personne du monde.—<span class='sc'>Anne
Hyde.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was the “infidèle” meant for Spencer Compton
or Harry Jermyn? Do the plaintive words
point to the bitterness of supposed desertion
by one higher than either? When were they
written? There is no date to guide us.</p>

<p class='c012'>Elsewhere there is a mention of one, her aunt
Barbara Aylesbury, greatly beloved:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Je l’aime plus que moy-mesne mille fois.—<span class='sc'>Anne
Hyde.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>But on another page (it must have been much
earlier), the girl, as girls will, sets down gravely
the short story of her young life, here transcribed:</p>

<p class='c015'>“If I live till the 22 of March 1653, I am 16
yeare old. My dear Aunt Bab was when she
died 24 yeare old and as much as from Aprell
to August.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> (This is the Barbara Aylesbury
of the other entry.) “I was borne the 12 day
of March old stile in the yeare of our Lord 1637
at Cranbourne Lodge neer Windsor in Barkshire
and lived in my owne country till I was
12 yeares old haveing in that time seen the ruin
both of Church and State in the murtheringe
of my Kinge. The first of May old stile 1649
I came out of England being then 12 yeares
old 1 month and 15 days. I came to Antwerp
6 of May old stile the August following I went
to Bruxells for 3 or 4 days and returned againe
to Antwerp where I stayed 3 weekes being loged
at the court of her Highness the Princess Royall.
I returned to Antwerp in May where I have
been ever since February 8 1653. I am now
15 years old.”</p>

<div class='fn c016'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Barbara, daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, died in
September 1652. (Nicholas Papers.)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>So abruptly the record ends. The writer
has no more to say, for she is yet only on the
threshold of life.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turn the page. Over the leaf in another hand,
large and straggling, someone has inscribed a
final memorandum. The little book would
never be wanted by its owner any more, but
there was room for this.</p>

<p class='c015'>“On the 3 day of March being fryday the
Dutchess dyed at St James and was buried the
wednesday following 1671.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the two dates a little span of years,
not a score; and yet how great a sum of the
things which go to fill up life—of hope and love
and splendour, of pain and grief and disappointment.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c012'>It is this story that we try now to construct
out of the memorials of her time; the life story
of the woman who, without any extraordinary
beauty or charm, so far as we are able to judge,
to balance the comparative obscurity from
which she sprang, was fated in an age when
the claims of high birth were jealously guarded
to become the wife of a Prince of the Blood
Royal of England.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Even in the seventeenth century, gilded as it
was by the slowly dying radiance of romance,
the “glory and the dream” of chivalry, the
strange tale reads like a fable, and yet the life,
short as it was, of Anne Hyde, had results for
her age and country which even now can hardly
be measured accurately and dispassionately,
like the ever-widening circles on the surface of a
pool into which a pebble has been cast.</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>There</span> is, after all, something to be said for the
birth of Anne Hyde.</p>
<p class='c012'>Edward Hyde, the famous Chancellor and
historian of the Great Rebellion, though the
first peer of his name, could still, quite honestly,
boast of long and honourable descent.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Hydes of Norbury, in the county
of Cheshire, celebrated by Camden in his
“Britannia,” had handed down that possession
from father to son since the far-back days before
the Norman Conquest, but the first of the race
with whom we need concern ourselves is the
grandfather of the future Chancellor.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

the Restoration of the Royal Family,” written by himself.

<p class='c012'>Evelyn’s “Correspondence.” To Mr Sprat, Chaplain to
the Duke of Buckingham, afterwards Bishop of Rochester.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Laurence, the seventh son of Robert Hyde
of Norbury, could claim, naturally, but a small
provision from the paternal resources, but his
mother seems to have looked carefully to his
education, as the best chance for his future, and
he was placed as a clerk in one of the auditors’
offices of the Exchequer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence he was employed in the affairs of Sir
Thomas Thynne, who under Protector Somerset
in a short time raised a great estate, and was
the first of his name to possess Longleat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Laurence Hyde, however, held the post little
more than a year—and gained nothing by it—but
soon afterwards he married Anne, widow of
Matthew Colthurst of Claverton, near Bath,
who brought him a fair fortune, and by this
marriage he had four sons and four daughters,
the sons being Robert, Laurence, Henry and
Nicholas. He bought, at the time of his
marriage, the manor of West Hatch in the
county of Wilts, but at his death he left the
greater part of his estate to his widow.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of the four sons above mentioned, the second,
named also Laurence, became eventually “a
lawyer of great name and practice,” being
attorney to Queen Anne of Denmark, and obtaining
knighthood in due course. His next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>brother, by name Henry, was at the time of
his father’s death already entered at the Middle
Temple, being a good scholar and a Master of
Arts of Oxford. He was supposed (probably
by his brothers and sisters) to be his mother’s
favourite, and perhaps it was because he was the
“spoilt child,” that he stoutly announced that
“he had no mind to the law” but wished to
enlarge his mind by travel. Having with some
difficulty, as may be conjectured, extracted his
mother’s unwilling consent, he went joyfully
off on the Grand Tour, going through Germany
from Spa to Italy. There he visited Florence,
Siena and Rome, which, by the way, was then
inhibited to the subjects of Elizabeth, and he
somehow managed to obtain the protection of
Cardinal Allen, probably a very necessary precaution.
However, in due time Henry Hyde
came safely back from what was then, and for
long afterwards, considered a perilous undertaking,
and was of course on his return persuaded
forthwith to marry.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wife who was chosen was Mary, one of
the daughters and heirs of Edward Longford of
Trowbridge, and Henry Hyde appears from
this time to have settled down peaceably in his
native county. He served as burgess for some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>neighbouring boroughs in many parliaments,
and moreover, like his father before him, had
a numerous family of four sons and five
daughters.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of his sons, the third, Edward, lived to be the
Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Edward Hyde was born at his father’s house
of Dinton, Wilts, on 18th February 1609, and
as a child was taught by a schoolmaster to whom
his father presented the living.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the fashion of those days, which peopled
both the universities with mere children, the
boy was sent at the age of thirteen to Magdalen
Hall, Oxford, and thereafter entered at the
Middle Temple by his uncle, Nicholas Hyde,
afterwards Lord Chief Justice of the King’s
Bench.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Autobiography of Sir John Bramston.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In his early youth there came to Edward
Hyde an experience which seems to us to embody
a brief and sad romance. He married
in 1629 the daughter of Sir George Ayliffe of
Gretenham in his own county of Wilts, but
before six months were past, the poor young
bride was smitten by smallpox, that scourge of
the seventeenth century, and died. He says
of himself that “he bore her Loss with so great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Passion and Confusion of spirit that it shook all
the frame of his Resolutions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>However, in 1632, when he was but twenty-four,
the young widower repaired his loss by a
second marriage with Frances, daughter of
Sir Thomas Aylesbury, a union which proved to
be a very happy one. With reference to this
marriage Sir Bernard Burke, in his “Romance
of the Aristocracy,” gives a curious tradition
respecting the descent of Frances Aylesbury.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some time early in the seventeenth century,
a barefooted and destitute girl arrived one day
at a roadside tavern in the village of Chelsea,
and being kindly welcomed there, told the landlord
that she was tramping to London, hoping to
take service there. As it happened, the situation
of “pot-girl” was then vacant at the
Blue Dragon, and “Anne” forthwith stepped
into the place. A rich brewer was in the habit
of coming every day for his evening draught,
and being attracted by the girl’s manner and
appearance, married her within three months.
Before long he died, leaving “Anne” a wealthy
widow, to whom came many suitors. From
among these she chose Sir Thomas Aylesbury,
Master of Requests and the Mint, who moreover
possessed lands in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>After many years there arose a dispute as to
the property of the late brewery, and Lady
Aylesbury was recommended to employ a young
barrister, by name Edward Hyde, who was
destined thereafter to become her son-in-law.</p>

<p class='c012'>From this tale was drawn the obvious conclusion
that the two queens of England, Mary
and Anne, were great-granddaughters of a
beggar maid.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately Burke merely gives the romantic
story for what it is worth, and suggests that very
probably it was coined after the Restoration by
some one of Hyde’s numerous enemies, who were
envious of his steady ascent to rank and distinction,
and found a theory of obscure connections
very comforting to their own souls.</p>

<p class='c012'>In February 1634 we find young Hyde
appointed one of the managers of a masque
presented before the King by the Inns of Court,
as a protest against Prynne’s furious attack on
the drama.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thither came King Charles, stately and gracious,
forgetting perhaps for a brief moment the
heavy clouds now gathering low on his horizon
to cover the sky as with a pall: with dreaming,
melancholy eyes intent for a little space on
the scene which the masquers unfolded before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>him; where, a little before, Ben Jonson had
brought many beautiful and dainty fancies to
such rare perfection—but on this occasion it
was “The Triumph of Peace,” by James
Shirley.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, on that winter evening, in that great
and splendid hall, shone all the glitter and
pageantry and poetic thought so soon to be for
long years eclipsed, leaving a pathetic memory
to be cherished through many weary seasons of
strife and disaster by those who had seen it.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Whether young Hyde at this time attracted
the King’s special attention or not, we have no
record, but his progress was a steady one.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to what manner of man he was, we have
his own words. In the curious sententious
method of introspection and self-analysis employed
by the thinkers of that age, Hyde speaks
of himself as “in his nature inclined to Pride
and Passion, and to a humour between Wrangling
and Disputing very troublesome”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>; but
he certainly possessed the art of attracting the
friendship of some of the finest spirits of that
stormy age, which, like all periods of stress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>produced many such to shine like lamps in their
time. There were the poets Carew and Cotton,
the elder Godolphin, Evelyn, who extols Hyde’s
“great and signal merits,” and greatest and
noblest of all, Lucius Carey, Lord Falkland.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>If, as has been said, a man is known by his
friends, then it may surely be counted to Edward
Hyde for righteousness that he had eyes to
discern the shining of that “steadfast star” too
early extinguished. There is nothing more inspiring
in English literature than the words in
which he chronicles the going out of that light,
the death of his hero on the red field which gave
that pure spirit the peace it craved so earnestly.
“Thus,” says the historian, “fell that incomparable
young man in the four and thirtieth
year of his age, having so much despatched the
business of life that the oldest rarely attain to
that immense knowledge, and the youngest
enters not into the world with more innocence,
and whosoever leads such a life need not care
upon how short warning it be taken from
him.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Edward Hyde’s link with the great Villiers
family procured for him powerful interest, and
prompted him to vindicate the detested memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of the first Duke of Buckingham. This Villiers
connection was due partly to Hyde’s first
marriage, as there seems to have been a relationship
with the Ayliffes of Gretenham, and partly
to his father-in-law, Sir Thomas Aylesbury.
He, being a distinguished mathematician, had
been secretary first to the Earl of Nottingham,
Lord High Admiral of England, and then to the
latter’s successor, Buckingham. To the influence
of the powerful favourite he owed his posts
of Master of Requests and of the Mint. Anthony
Wood says that Sir Thomas sat for a short time
in Parliament in the former capacity, and as a
matter of form at Oxford in 1643 after the
beginning of the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c012'>His Cavalier sympathies procured for him the
sentence of banishment from England, and he
died at Breda at the age of eighty-one. His
son, who at the instance of Charles I. had translated
Davila’s “History of the Civil Wars in
France,” was for a time tutor to the second Duke
of Buckingham and his young brother Lord
Francis Villiers, who in his turn merits one word
at least. Nothing in the history of the great
strife has been chronicled more heroic nor more
pathetic than the fate of that boy—for he
was no more—at Kingston-on-Thames. A true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Villiers, “prodigal of his person,” he fiercely
rejected quarter, and with his back against a
tree fought valiantly till he went down under
the swords of the Roundheads, “nine wounds in
his beautiful face and body.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Yet it was
better so—better to die in the flush of chivalrous,
unstained youth, than to live out such a life as
his brother’s, a life blackened by degrading
vice, gasped out alone, in the “worst inn’s
worst room,” as Pope declared (though this has
been denied), the last male of his race.</p>

<p class='c012'>To return to the Aylesbury tutor of the Villiers
brothers; he lived abroad in exile for a time,
and having been obliged to return to England
in 1650, he again left the country, and died six
years later in Jamaica, being then secretary to
Major-General Sedgwick.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another of Edward Hyde’s friends was Sir
Edmund Verney, “of great courage and generally
beloved,”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> that gallant standard-bearer
who was destined to fall at Edgehill at the beginning
of the war, but who as long as he lived,
with Hyde and Falkland, might be considered
to represent the moderate or constitutional
loyalists. Having in 1634 been appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>keeper of writs and rolls of Common Pleas, we
find Hyde later emerging into the arena of public
life. In 1640 he organised the royal party in
the Commons, and on the eve of the outbreak
drew up the state papers for the Royalist press.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
With Colepepper, afterwards famous as a general,
and his friend Falkland, Hyde joined the King
at York. At this time he was member for
Wotton Basset in his own county of Wilts,
having been also called to serve for Shaftesbury,
which however he declined. At the dissolution
of the Short Parliament in 1640 he was again,
in the constitution of the Long Parliament,
returned for his own constituency. At some
time he also seems to have represented Saltash.
At any rate, from the date above referred to,
he gave up his practice at the Bar, and devoted
himself to “public business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We have it under his hand that as late as 1639
the “three kingdoms” were “flourishing in
entire Peace and universal Plenty,” yet we
cannot but think that any one so far-seeing and
sagacious as Edward Hyde must have detected
the first low mutterings of the gathering storm
by that time. His personal enmity to Cromwell
began early, and at the beginning of the Long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Parliament he was attacked by the bitter
Puritan Fiennes for his steady attachment to
the Church.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> It was then that he was first
sent for by the King, who wished to thank him
personally for his defence both of himself and
of the Church, and from this date begins his
close association with Charles. With Prince
Rupert, loyal nephew and gallant soldier as he
showed himself to be, Hyde was never on good
terms, neither were his two colleagues,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and
the trio before mentioned, whether for good or
evil, steadily opposed the sometimes headlong
counsels of the brilliant Prince Palatine.</p>

Palatine,” by Mrs Steuart Erskine.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>One of Hyde’s first actions after his election
was to secure the suppression of the Earl
Marshal’s Court, while soon after his dispute
with Fiennes, the King wished to appoint him
Solicitor-General, though Hyde declined the
post. The triumvirate, Colepepper, Falkland
and Hyde himself, steadfast, upright and loyal,
constantly met to consult on the King’s affairs,
in the hope—a vain one as it proved—of stemming
the incoming tide of misfortune. At the
beginning of 1643, Hyde was sworn of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Privy Council, and made Chancellor of the Exchequer,
but in common with many other of the
King’s most faithful and wisest servants, we find
him deploring the Queen’s unbounded influence
over her husband, who, since Buckingham’s
untimely and tragic death from the dagger of
Felton, had had no supreme adviser. Before
Henrietta left for Holland on her expedition
to procure supplies with the jewels she pledged
there, she exacted from the King two utterly
preposterous promises: first, to receive no one
who had ever “disserved him” into favour, and
secondly, not to make peace without her consent.
After the fatal loss of Falkland at Newbury
fight in this year, the King was anxious to
make Hyde Secretary of State, but the latter
declined this office also, and it was conferred on
Digby.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> But early in the succeeding year the
Chancellor received a proof of his master’s
absolute confidence, as he was entrusted with
the care of the Prince of Wales.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>On the 4th March 1644, though neither master
nor servant was to know it, Edward Hyde
parted from King Charles for the last time on
earth, and set out for the west of England
with the boy whose life for the next sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>years was to be one of weary and ceaseless
wandering.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Pendennis in Cornwall they went to
Scilly and on to Jersey. Here Hyde himself
stayed for two years with Sir George Carteret,
remaining after the Prince left the island for
Paris in 1646, both Capel and Hopton having
gone before him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Queen’s mischievous jealousy of Hyde,
which had begun early, had not abated, and she
still wrote to the harassed and almost despairing
King letters calculated to prejudice him still
further against the former. Charles, in this
case, does not seem to have been really influenced
by them, for he wrote to the Chancellor
that he wished him to join his son as soon as he
left France, and even Henrietta herself must have
been seized with some compunction, for she sent
for Hyde in 1648. As soon as he received the
summons the latter went to Caen, then to
Rouen, and hearing the Prince was to go to
Holland he went to Dieppe to wait, glad probably
of an excuse to avoid the unwelcome interview
with the Queen. Thence he joined Lord
Cottington in a frigate going to Dunkirk, but
they were taken by pirates, who, however, did
no worse than convey them to Ostend, whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the Chancellor was able to join the Prince of
Wales at the Hague.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was at this time that Hyde came into contact
with one of the greatest and noblest of his
king’s servants, but one who was yet the object
of bitter jealousy at the hands of many of his
own party, no less than at those of his enemies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Montrose was then in Holland, after the
disaster of Philiphaugh, hoping, plotting, working,
with the restless, passionate, indomitable
energy which had achieved so much in the past,
yet which was destined to fail so utterly in the
future. At a village near The Hague the two
met, the grave lawyer and the hot soldier, to
confer on the state of Scotland and the prospects
therein of the master whom they both served
with whole-hearted and ungrudging devotion.</p>

<p class='c012'>There they parted, and Montrose came back
to his distracted country to raise anew the
standard, to fight his last fight, to be betrayed
by the basest of traitors, to die a dishonoured
death, as his enemies called it, which was to earn
for him, nevertheless, imperishable fame; and
Hyde was to toil on steadfastly for long strenuous
years, destined to bring him fame and place
and wealth, and to bring him likewise fresh
exile and bitter disillusion in his age.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>After Hyde’s mission as ambassador to Spain
with his friend Lord Cottington was accomplished,
he was at last able to send for his wife
and children to join him in the Low Countries,
but before he met them at Antwerp he made a
journey to Paris to see the widowed queen, for
by this time the tragedy at Whitehall had been
consummated, and Hyde’s young charge was
king <i>de jure</i> if not <i>de facto</i>. Henrietta seems to
have been still possessed with the idea that the
Chancellor’s influence with her son was adverse
to her interests, but she received him civilly on
this occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the disastrous defeat of Worcester in
1651, and his own romantic escape, Charles II.
bethought him of Hyde, and sent for him to
Paris, keeping him chiefly with him in Flanders
on their return there, until his own departure
for Germany.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>During this time, Mary, Princess Royal of

a firm friend to her father’s old servant, and
evinced great kindness to his family, providing
them with a house rent free at Breda some time
during the autumn of 1653, Breda being then

dearest to him, as far as one can judge a fairly

attachment to the religion and polity of the
Church of England, a determination to maintain
what he considered the true ideal of the English
constitution, and a desire for personal advancement,”
this last attribute—ambition—could
have had little to feed on during those years at

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>It</span> was at Cranborne Lodge in Windsor Park,
the official home of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, that
his grandchild, Edward Hyde’s eldest daughter,
was born on the 12th March 1637, and baptized
by the name of Anne, that of her father’s first
wife. It may be mentioned that there is a tradition,

</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Of her early childhood nothing has come down
to us, but in May 1649 the mother with her five
children set out for Antwerp. It was the dreary
year when, immediately following the King’s
execution, many of the broken and impoverished
Cavaliers and their families saw no prospect for
the future save in leaving their distracted
country, and the Hydes did as their neighbours.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hyde himself, as we have seen, had been
despatched hither and thither in the service of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the young King, and when at length he rejoined
his family, it was at Breda.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Princess of Orange was always as staunch
a champion of her native country as she was a
passionately loving sister to her exiled brothers,
and she was ready at all times to extend a
welcome to the forlorn and beggared English.
Hyde, moreover, had been, as she knew, an
absolutely trusted and faithful servant of the
slaughtered father whose memory she cherished
so fondly, and she lavished every possible attention
on him and his family. She was upheld
here by the good offices of Daniel O’Neill of the
King’s bodyguard, a great friend of Hyde’s, who
threw all his influence into the balance in his
favour. Mary, we have seen, gave tangible
proof of her attachment to the exiled Chancellor,
as she generously provided a house at Breda,
free of charge, for him and his family. Here
then, Hyde, as we have said, set up his household
gods. So many of the banished English
were coming and going about the Princess
Mary’s Court and the person of her brother
during many years, that the Chancellor was by
no means destitute of old friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among these, not the least beloved and
trusted was Morley, afterwards Bishop successively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of Worcester and Winchester. He<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> had
had a brilliant record as to learning. A king’s
scholar of Westminster at fourteen, he had been
elected to Christ Church at seventeen, and at
Oxford had numbered among his friends
Hammond, Sanderson, Sheldon, Chillingworth
and also Falkland, who had often received him
at Great Tew, where one can fancy the two
musing together over books, and communing on
all heaven and earth. He was, to some extent,
tainted with Calvinism, but nevertheless, as a
royal chaplain, gave his first year’s stipend for
the help of the king in war, and later was deprived
of his canonry and the rectory of Mildenhall
by the Parliament. He was present with
the chivalrous Arthur, Lord Capel, on the
scaffold, aiding him with his prayers, and soon
after went into exile, first in Paris, then at Breda
where he took up his abode with the Hydes.
We find his old friend the Chancellor, who called
him “the best man alive,” recommending him
as a spiritual adviser to Lady Morton, and much
later we shall see how far his influence availed
with his pupil, Hyde’s daughter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Another of her father’s friends and advisers,
destined to be in close contact with him in later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>years, was Gilbert Sheldon, afterwards Archbishop
of Canterbury.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Belonging as he did to
the school of Laud and Andrewes, his views on
certain points differed widely from those of
Morley, yet both were alike in their unswerving
loyalty to the King. Both, too, enjoyed the
friendship of Falkland as of Hyde, who indeed
made Sheldon one of the trustees of his papers
during his exile. Like the bulk of his fellows,
the latter suffered imprisonment, being ejected
from his College of All Souls, for his “malignancy.”
After the Restoration he was high in
the King’s favour, nevertheless he did not
hesitate to refuse to admit Charles to Holy
Communion, on the score of the latter’s evil life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In the house at Breda, sedulously cared for
by her parents, Anne, the elder, and by her
father at least the best beloved daughter,
reached her seventeenth year. She was a
clever, thoughtful girl, unusually well read for
the period and circumstances of her life, a devout
churchwoman under the guidance of Morley and
her father, looking out on the life unfolding before
her with a mind which then at least showed
singular powers of balance and perception.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be stated in parenthesis, that the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>daughter of the house was Frances, who subsequently
married Sir Thomas Keighley of
Hartingfordbury in Herts, but nothing beyond
the bare fact is recorded of her, after childhood,
though Evelyn mentions her as a guest at his
house in 1673. The year 1654 was destined to
bring about a change in the life of Anne which
was to prove more momentous than anyone
could foresee.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the household of Mary, Princess of Orange,
there was a maid of honour, one Mistress Kate
Killigrew. An outbreak of smallpox at Spa
drove the Court to take refuge at Aix-la-Chapelle,
but Mistress Killigrew had already been smitten
with the disease and died.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without loss of time the Stuart princess
nominated Chancellor Hyde’s young daughter
to the vacant post. In this she was backed
by her brother Charles, for whom she had hired
a house in Aix, keeping also a table for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The proposed honour was, however, by no
means so welcome as might be supposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>For one thing, the queen-mother, always a
woman of impulse and violent prejudice, had
in no degree abated her dislike to Hyde, and
everyone was aware of the fact. O’Neill, it
seems, declaring that the Princess herself had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>so much kindness for the Chancellor’s daughter
that she long resolved to have her upon the first
vacancy, suggested to his friend to ask for the
post for Anne, a proceeding to which Hyde
strongly objected, no doubt smarting under the
knowledge of Henrietta’s attitude towards him.
He had, he said, “but one daughter, who was
all the company and comfort her mother had
in her melancholic retirement,”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and therefore
he was resolved not to separate them, nor to
dispose his daughter to a “Court life,” “which
he did in truth perfectly detest.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is possible that the younger daughter, then an infant,

<p class='c012'>In the old days when the dwindling Court
had sojourned at Oxford, he had seen enough
and more than enough of the turmoil of intrigues
and jealousy, the incessant petty warfare between
the rival factions of Henrietta and her
husband, which the latter at any rate had been
powerless to control, and naturally Hyde was
sickened of it all, and unwilling to venture his
“Nan” into a like atmosphere. About the
same time we find him writing to Secretary
Nicholas on the matter: “I presume you think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>my wife a fool for being so indulgent to her girl
as to send her abroad on such a gadding journey.
I am very glad she hath had the good fortune
to be graciously received by her Royal Highness,
but I think it would be too much vanity
in me to take any notice of it.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>As before said, the King put his oar in, saying
to the Chancellor “his sister having seen his
daughter several times, liked her so well that she
desired to have her about her person, and had
spoken to him herself, to move it so as to prevent
displeasure from the Queen, therefore he knew
not why Hyde should neglect such an opportunity
of providing for his daughter in so
honourable a way.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>To this Hyde answered: “He could not
dispute the reasons with him, only that He could
not give himself Leave to deprive his Wife of
her Daughter’s Company, nor believe that She
could be more advantageously bred than under
her Mother”—another shaft aimed at the
influence of a Court.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Finally Mary herself bore down all opposition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>She had her full share of the family obstinacy,
and was determined to carry her point. In the
end, as might be supposed, she succeeded.
Hyde himself went to her, and said candidly
that “if it had not been for her bounty in
assigning them a house where they might live
rent free they could not have been able to
subsist,” and he therefore “confessed it was not
in his power to make his daughter such an allowance
as would enable her to live in her Royal
Highness’ Court conformably to the position
that was offered to her.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The Princess promptly answered that she did
not mean him to maintain his daughter in her
service, as she took that upon herself, so the
father reluctantly withdrew his opposition,
saying “he left his daughter to be disposed by
her mother.” On this point Lady Hyde had
consulted Morley, and, probably to her husband’s
surprise, that adviser counselled the acceptance
of the Princess’s offer, on which the latter,
recognising her triumph, remarked cheerfully:
“I warrant you my Lady and I will agree on
the matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One cannot but wonder at Hyde’s backwardness,
for he was then so poor that he was forced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to borrow of Nicholas small sums to pay postage
for King Charles. One member of the English
royal family there was who heartily approved
and upheld the appointment. The Queen of
Bohemia, Elizabeth Stuart, that unlucky
“Queen of Hearts” who attracted to herself
through so many stormy years the chivalrous
devotion, among others, of the gallant Lord
Craven, was at all times accustomed to speak
and write her mind. On 7th September 1654
she wrote to Sir Edward Nicholas: “I heare
Mrs Hide is to come to my neece in Mrs Killigrew’s
place which I am verie glad of. She is
verie fitt for itt, and a great favorit of mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>One advantage Hyde himself reaped from his
daughter’s advancement. He records that his
wife, “when she had presented her Daughter
to the Princess, came herself to reside with her
Husband to his great Comfort and which he
could not have enjoyed if the other Separation
had not been made, and possibly that Consideration
had the more easily disposed him to consent
to the other.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The girl’s own feeling in the matter is expressed

<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>October, which, under the ceremonious address
then alone admissible, breathes a spirit of strong
family affection.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she entered upon the duties of her new life,
if with a certain shy reluctance, yet probably
with a more or less eager curiosity and anticipation,

adequately the demands of this altered sphere.</p>

<p class='c012'>As might be supposed, Queen Henrietta, on
hearing of the appointment, flew into a passion

<p class='c011'>Anne once established in her new post, the
Queen of Bohemia did not forget her sentiments
of friendship, for on the 16th November<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
we find her again writing to Secretary Nicholas
from the “Hagh” (Elizabeth’s spelling was at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>any rate no worse than her neighbours’): “I
pray remember me to Mr Chancellor and tell
him his Ladie and my favorit his daughter came
hither upon Saterday and are gone this day to
Teiling. I finde my favourit growen euerie
way to her advantage.” A little later, too, that
is, on 11th January 1654-1655, she tells the same
correspondent: “We had a Royaltie though
not vpon twelf night at Teiling where my neece
was a gipsie and became her dress extream
well.” “Mrs Hide was a shepherdesse and I
assure you was verie handsome in it, none but
her Mistress looked better than she did. I
beleeve my Lady Hide and Mr Chancellor will
not be sorie to heare it which I pray tell them
from me.” It was a kind little message from
one mother to another. Elizabeth Stuart’s
roving life had perhaps taught her sympathy,
grafted on to the traditional good nature of her
family. It is all the more surprising that her
own large flock of children “got on,” as one says,
so badly with their mother, though she did
care more for her sons than for her daughters.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
However, that she took a fancy to “Nan Hyde”
was certain. Beauty, it is true, was lavishly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>distributed among those high-spirited, high-handed
Princes and Princesses Palatine (among
whom their cousin Charles II. so nearly found a
bride), but it was probably Anne’s acute perception
and strong intellect that appealed to
their brilliant mother. Nevertheless she could,
as we have seen, look with a keen and appreciative
eye on the girl’s personal appearance.
Anne at eighteen was at her best. The large
frame had not yet thickened into the proportions
which so early in life discounted her claims
to beauty. She had the charm of expression,
of good eyes, of vivacity, and then at least of
exuberant spirits.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Royaltie” which the Queen describes
was not unique. There were many such revels
at the Court of The Hague. The Princess Mary,
recovered from the shock of her early widowhood,
and eager for enjoyment, loved these
occasions, and shone at them with hereditary
grace, while in every festive gathering her maids
necessarily bore their part. The Queen writes
to her nephew, Charles II., during the same
January of another Royalty—she wrote to him
very often, by the way:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Though I believe you had more meat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>drink at Hannibal Sestade’s, yet I am sure our
fiddles were better and dancers; your sister
was very well dressed like an amazon; the
Princess Tarente like a shepherdess; Mademoiselle
d’Orange, a nymph. They were all
very well dressed, but I wished all the night
your Majesty had seen Vanderdons. There never
was seen the like; he was a gipsy, Nan Hyde
was his wife; he had pantaloons close to him
of red and yellow striped, with ruffled sleeves;
he looked just like a Jock-a-lent. They were
twenty-six in all, and came [not?] home till
five o’clock in the morning.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A little before this Elizabeth had written to
the same correspondent of the amusements of
his sister:</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear niece recovers her health and good
looks extremely by her exercises, she twice
dancing with the maskers; it has done her
much good. We had it two nights, the first time
it was deadly cold, but the last time the weather
was a little better. The subject your Majesty
will see was not extraordinary, but it was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>well danced. Our Dutch minister said nothing
against it, but a little French preacher, Carré,
by his sermon set all the church a-laughing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An early allusion to the festivities in which
Anne Hyde afterwards shared and shone.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c012'>In the year 1655, within a few months of her
appointment in the Princess Mary’s service,
Anne’s young charms of mind and body brought
to her feet at least one lover worth the winning.</p>

<p class='c012'>At The Hague, in those days, among the many
exiled Cavaliers who were generally made welcome
at the Court of their young King’s elder
sister, was Sir Spencer Compton, not the least
distinguished of his gallant race. He was the
youngest son of the loyal Earl of Northampton,
and when but a child wept bitterly because he
could not go forth to battle with his chivalrous
brothers, seeing his small fingers could not grasp
one of the great wheel-lock pistols of that day.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
With characteristic contempt of concealment,
he made no secret of his passion for Mistress
Anne. Charles II. himself with his usual love
of mischief wrote to Henry Bennet, afterwards
Lord Arlington: “I will try whether Sir Spencer
Compton be so much in love as you say, for I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>will name Mrs Hyde before him so by chance
except that he be very much smitten it shall not
at all move him.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> We are not told how young
Compton stood the test, but it was pretty
enough, that love-idyll of youth presented
among the sylvan shades of the wooded Hague,
though whether from interference or the coldness
of the young maid of honour it was destined
to fade quickly and pass into the limbo of things
forgotten. One would like to know the story,
but nothing more remains to us. Another
suitor was Lord Newburgh, of whom Sir George
Radcliffe wrote from Paris in the spring:
“Onely one tould me yesterday a pretty story
of him y<sup>t</sup> he must marry Mr Chancellor’s
daughter (who waites of y<sup>e</sup> Princesse Royale)
and so by ye Chanc: meanes be engaged in all
the Scots affaires. The Chanc: has much talke
of him at y<sup>e</sup> Pallais Royale where he is thought
to be a powerfull man at y<sup>e</sup> Court at Cologne.
A person of honour would needs persuade me
that y<sup>e</sup> Princesse Royall had provided for 3 of
his children (which was 2 more than I had heard
on).” Here there is a touch of the jealousy of
Hyde’s influence and prosperity which was
afterwards so widely spread.</p>

<p class='c012'>We hear also of some sentimental passages
with the conquering Harry Jermyn, who was
said, on what authority it is now difficult to
decide, to have been afterwards privately
married to the Princess Mary. The same story,
by the way, was told of his uncle, the elder
Jermyn, and Queen Henrietta.</p>

<p class='c012'>How far, however, the heart of the maid of
honour was really concerned in these fleeting
love affairs it is useless to conjecture. She was
probably ready enough to be amused, and,
conscious that she was not a beauty, to be
flattered at such homage.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was not idle, either; she was always fond
of writing and ready with the pen, and at some
time during her service—there is no date
attached—Anne bethought her to set down in
writing the character of her royal mistress. The
manuscript is not in the girl’s own hand, but it
is endorsed: “Pourtrait of ye Princess Royall
drawne by Mrs Anne Hyde.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ceux qui connoissent l’admirable Princesse
dont j’entreprend le portrait trouveront bien
étrange qu’une personne si peu capable que moy,
de la bien representer oze l’hazarder a un si grand
ouvrage et on m’accusera assurement de vanité
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>ou de folie. Mais comme j’y suis toute preparée
cela ne m’exonnera pas ni ne m’empêchera de
commencer comme je ‘avois resolue, en vous
disant qu’elle a la taille la plus belle et la plus
libre du monde et qu’oy qu’Elle n’est pas des
plus grandes il s’en voy beaucoup plus au dessous
qu’au dessus de la Sienne elle a les cheveux d’un
fort beau brun fort lustre et en grande quantité,
les yeux grands et si beaux et brillans qu’on a
de la peine a en supporter l’esclar. Son nes est
un peu grand mais si bien fait que cela n’otte
rien de la beauté de son visage. Sa bouche est
fort belle, et les lèvres des plus vermeilles que
l’on puisse voir, les dens belles, le tour du visage
parfaitement beau, et le teint se uniet si beau
qu’il ne se puisse rien voir au monde qui l’égalle,
la gorge belle, les bras et les mains de mesme.
Enfin on vois en toute sa personne quelque chose
de si grande et de si relevée que sans la connoistre
on verroit combien elle est au dessus du
reste du monds. Elle a meilleure mine que
personne, et quoy qu’Elle a asses de douceur
pour luy gaigner le cœur de tous ceux qui la
voyent. Elle a aussi une certaine fierte qui luy
fait craindre et respecter de tous le monde et
qui sied fort bien a une personne de sa condition.
Pour son intérieur il est tellement impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>de la connoistre, qu’il est bien difficile pour moy
d’y bien reussir; pour de l’esprit, Elle en a infiniment
mais de l’esprit vif et penetrant et qui
la rend de la meilleure humeur du monde, quand
Elle veut obliger ceux avec qui Elle se trouve;
mais quand Elle ne se plait pas, Elle est tout a
fait retirée, ne pouvant se contraindre pour qui
que se soit quoy qu’Elle est generallement civile,
mais Elle regarde la contrainte comme une chose
peu necessaire aux personnes de sa qualité,
les croyans plus faits pour eux mesmes, que
pour les autres; Et c’est ce qui est cause qu’Elle
parle moins que personne quand Elle est dans
des Compagnies ou Elle ne veut pas estre tout
a fait familière; cela fait a croire a ceux qui
ne la connoissent pas qu’Elle est plus glorieuse
qu’Elle n’est en effet, il est vray qu’Elle l’est
un peu mais il ne luy mésied point, car il y a
asseurement une espèce de gloire qui est necessaire
à toutes les femmes et sur toutes a celles
de sa naissance: Elle est tout a fait genereuse,
et oblige de bonne grace ceux pour qui Elle a
de l’amitié, il est vray qu’Elle n’en a pas pour
beaucoup, mais Elle est parfaitement bonne amie
où elle en fait profession et ne change jamais,
à moins que de luy donner grand sujet, mais
quand Elle a une fois mauvaise opinion d’une
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>personne pour qui Elle a eue de l’amitié, on ne
se remet jamais bien avec Elle, quoy qu’en
apparence Elle vit fort bien avec eux; ce qui
marque qu’Elle est plus dissimulée qu’Elle ne
croit. Elle est asses colere qu’oy qu’Elle ne le
temoigne guere car en ses humeurs la Elle se
renferme des apres diners entieres sans voir qui
que se soit; Elle parait plus indifferente que
personne, mais ceux qui ont l’honneur de la voir
souvent, peuvent remarquer qu’Elle n’est pas
incapable des sentimens de l’amitié et de la
haine: Elle ne se mocque jamais de qui que se
soit, ni ne rompe jamais en visière, mais Elle
n’est pas faschée de faire de petites malices,
qui peuvent mettre ses gens en peine mais c’est
tousjours a ceux dont Elle connoit tout a fois
les humeurs. Elle est fort constante en ses
resolutions, un peu trop quelque fois, car il y a
des temps on cela va jusques à l’opiniotreté;
Elle ne se mele jamais des affaires d’autruy, si
ce ne’est qu’on luy en parle le premier, et alors
Elle est tout a fait secrete, et donne ses avis
avec toute la franchise imaginable. En fin
Elle a toutes les qualites requises pour rendre
une personne parfaite; car outre ce que j’ay
deja dit, Elle danse mieux que qui se soit, mais
Elle est un peu paresseuse, ce qui est cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>qu’Elle songe moins à se diverter que personne,
et qu’Elle aime mieux passer son temps toute
seule dans sa Chambre que de prendre la peine
de s’ajuster pour une assemblée, quoy qu’Elle
y reusset mieux que personne n’a jamais fait.
Je n’aurois jamais fait si je voulois entreprendre
à depeindre toutes les admirables qualités de
cette grande Princesse. Je me contenteray
donc de finir en la supliant tres humblement
de pardonner toutes les fautes d’une Portrait,
qu’il est impossible de rendre aussi parfait que
son original, set qu’Elle aura la bonté de se
souvenir, que celle qui l’a fait est tellement
dediée à son service qu’Elle se croit seulement
heureuse parcequ’Elle est sienne, et qu’elle ne
plaint son faut d’esprit et de jugement que
parcequ’ils l’empeschent de representer comme
elle doit les admirables qualites de sa maitresse.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>If the flattery contained in this portrait may
be termed excessive, yet something is due to the
customs of the period, which almost enjoined
language of the kind. At the same time, Mary’s
pride of demeanour is insisted on in a way that
betrays some sense of injury, though this is
carefully veiled. Later we know Anne was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>suffer from the wrath and indignation of her
mistress, but there is no reason to suppose that
when she wrote these words she did not feel a
very real affection for the Princess, who had
braved her own mother’s anger and surmounted
various difficulties for the sake of the writer.
And moreover Mary, Princess of Orange, was a
Stuart. If she was haughty, imperious, at times
wayward, yet she had her share of the haunting,
ineffable charm of her doomed race, the charm
which attracted the homage of heart and life
of those round her, and bound them to her with
an imperishable chain. On the same theme
the maid of honour also ventured into poetry,
at any rate into rhyme. The effusion may
possibly be ascribed to the same date.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile Anne’s fate, all unsuspected, was
advancing towards her with swift and unfaltering
steps.</p>

<p class='c012'>Queen Henrietta had never been able to reconcile
to herself Princess Mary’s appointment
of Hyde’s daughter about her person, and since
its accomplishment had constantly appealed
to her to dismiss Anne from her service.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Lord
Hatton, in fact, writes: “The Queen’s last
sickness was by the chamber confident said
to be expressed by the Queen by reason of
some late letters from the young P<sup>rsse</sup> Orange
wherein she still contests for retaining with
her Sir E. H. daughter which the Queen will not

</div>

<p class='c012'>Mary was, however, quite as resolute as her
mother, and when in 1655 she formed the project
of a visit to Paris, it was with the intention
of taking her favourite in her train.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hyde, who as we have seen was fully conscious
of the queen-mother’s disapproval, wished
to take this opportunity of withdrawing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>daughter, but the Princess peremptorily refused,
declaring that it would be only necessary for
her mother to see Anne in order to abate her
unreasonable prejudice. The Chancellor’s unwillingness
in the matter can be gleaned from a
letter he wrote at the time to Lady Stanhope,
who had become the wife of John van der
Kirckhove Heenvliet, the Dutch Ambassador
despatched to England in 1641 to arrange the
marriage of Mary with the late Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>My very good Lady</span>”—so wrote Hyde<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>—“Though
the considerations and objections I
presumed to offer this last year against the high
grace and favour which your Royal Mistress was
then inclined to vouchsafe to my poor Girl,
were not thought reasonable or probable, yet
you now see that I had too much ground for
these apprehensions, and they who came last
from Paris are not reserved in declaring that the
Princess Royal’s receiving my Daughter into
her service is almost the only cause of the
Queen’s late reservation towards her Royal
Highness which I hope you believe is a very
great affliction to me. I most humbly beg your
Ladyship if you find any disposition in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Royal Highness out of her goodness to me to
give the girl leave to attend her in this journey,
when it seems others who have more title to
that honour must be left behind, that you will
consider whether the preferring her to this new
favour may not be an unhappy occasion of improving
her Majesty’s old dislike, and if there
be the least fear of that or appearance of any
domestic inconvenience by leaving others unsatisfied
I do beg you with all my heart, to use
your credit in diverting that Gracious purpose
in your Royal Mistress towards her, and let her
instead of waiting this journey, have leave to
spend a little time in the visitation of her friends
at Breda, and upon my credit, whatsoever in

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Whether this letter was laid before the
Princess or not, the journey was undertaken,
and she and her attendants began the long
projected expedition which was to be fraught
with such far-reaching results.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary set out in high spirits at the prospect
of the change, of seeing her mother (in spite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>their differences, which she probably considered
to be trivial) and of making the acquaintance
of the little sister who was yet a stranger to her,
Henrietta Anne, the child born at Exeter during
the siege, and brought to France through many
dangers, with real heroism and devotion, by
Lady Dalkeith.</p>

<p class='c012'>According to our ideas, the journey from The
Hague must have been a very long and tedious
one, but it was no doubt full of interest to the
Princess and her train. Each day furnished incidents
to engross and be discussed as the long
cavalcade of maids and men, of heavy baggage
waggons, of lumbering coaches, of numerous
pack-horses, of guards armed with dag and
musket, accoutred in back and breast plate—for
there was a body of sixty horse—flaunted
along the heavy, muddy roads. Here a wheel
would sink into the deep ruts, and the vehicle
be released with immense noise and bustle;
there an axle-tree would break and must be
mended at the cost of an hour or two’s delay,
while the shoeing smiths reaped a goodly harvest
by their task of replacing cast shoes. The
minister Heenvliet accompanied the Princess
to Antwerp and Brussels, at which place he left
her. At Mons ordnance was fired, torches were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>lighted, and the magistrates paid her the compliment,
customary in the case of royalty, of
asking from her the watchword for the night.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>So the procession passed on through the level,
dyke-protected tracts of Flanders, and came at
last to the frontier and the fair land of
France.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the splendid days of Charles the Bold, he
who had been Count of Flanders and the Netherlands
had been also Duke of Burgundy, a most
unwilling vassal to the French crown. Since
his time, that province of his great inheritance
had become part and parcel of the dominion of
King Louis, and when the Princess of Orange
halted at the ancient city of Peronne she was
well within French territory.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, at the capital of the old Burgundian
Duchy, she was met by her second brother,
James, Duke of York, at this time—through
no fault of his own—reduced to a life of inaction
at Paris, and here possibly began the prologue
of the romance which was to affect not only
his own life, but the future of the far-off country
of his birth. Of this more later. With the
Duke, and attached to his person, were the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Gerard and Sir Charles Berkeley, besides M.
Sanguin, <i>maître d’hôtel</i> to the French king.</p>

<p class='c012'>So accompanied Mary pursued her journey,
to be met by her mother and sister at Bourgel,
six miles from Paris.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of her stay in the French capital, though it
extended over a period of some months, there
are but scanty records, but that she entered fully
into all the gaiety which surrounded the boy
King is certain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anne Hyde appears to have caught smallpox
during the visit, but it was a slight attack and
she probably escaped without disfigurement.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
She had not been well early in the year, as
appears from Sir Alexander Hume’s letter from
Teyling on 22nd February.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether she won such golden opinions at
Paris does not appear, but probably she held
her own there as well as in Holland. She had
always plenty of self-possession, which carried
her through many anxious moments, and if any
special admirers manifested themselves there,
it must have been only to be flouted.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the image of one too high in place to be acknowledged
had already been imprinted on her
mind, she at least made no sign, but it is evident
that the young maid of honour was in no apparent
haste to change her condition, and was
capable of determination in the management
of her affairs. She did not succeed in overcoming
the prejudice of the English queen-mother,
and this was no doubt a cause of keen disappointment
and vexation to her own mistress.
Mary had also other reasons for annoyance
on her own account. Besides the fact of Frances
Stanhope’s conversion to Rome, which was
made as public as possible, she had to withstand
her mother’s pertinacity in this direction.
Henrietta, who never left a stone unturned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>bring her children over to her own faith, insisted
on taking her elder daughter with her to
her beloved convent at Chaillot, in the hope of
working on her feelings to the extent of securing
her for the fold of Rome. These efforts were
useless, but they made matters more or less
uncomfortable for the Princess, who moreover
strongly resented anything in the shape of
coercion. Keenly, therefore, as she appreciated
and admired the splendour and gaiety of the
French Court, her visit was not altogether free
from drawbacks. Nevertheless, she might have
prolonged her stay but for the intelligence of
her little son’s alarming illness. It turned
out to be only measles, and the child made a
good recovery, but his mother lost no time in
starting on her journey, and it was not long
before she and her train found themselves once
more at home. It is certain that the Princess
had at this time no suspicion of any understanding
between her brother and Anne Hyde,
for the latter remained in her service and high
in her favour till the year before the Restoration.
One glimpse we have of the English girl at this
time from the facile and often extremely amusing
pen of the Princess Palatine, Elizabeth
Charlotte, afterwards Duchesse d’Orléans, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>at that time a child. Her grandmother, the
Queen of Bohemia, brought her to Mary’s Court,
a wild, unruly little person, but she records
gratefully the fact that Mistress Hyde was kind
and good-natured.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My aunt [Sophia, Electress of Hanover] did
not visit the Princess Royal, but the Queen of
Bohemia did, and took me with her. Before I
set out, my aunt said to me: ‘Lisette, take care
not to behave as you generally do. Follow the
Queen step by step, that she may not have to
wait for you.’ ‘Oh, aunt,’ I replied, ‘you shall
hear how well I behave.’</p>

<p class='c029'>“When we arrived at the Princess Royal’s,
whom I did not know, I saw her son, whom I
had often played with. After gazing for a long
time at his mother, without knowing who she
was, I went back to see if I could find any one
who could tell me her name. Seeing only the
Prince of Orange, I said: ‘Pray can you tell
me who is that woman with so tremendous a
nose?’ He laughed and answered: ‘That is
my Mother, the Princess Royal.’</p>

<p class='c029'>“I was quite stupefied at the blunder I
had committed. Mdlle Hyde, perceiving my
confusion, took me with the Prince into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Princess’s bed chamber, where we played at all
sorts of games. I had told them to call me when
the Queen was ready to go. We were both
rolling on a Turkey carpet when I was summoned.
I arose in great haste, and ran into the
hall, but the Queen was already in the ante-chamber.
Without losing a moment I seized
the robe of the Princess Royal and, making her
a courtesy at the same time, placed myself
directly before her, and followed the Queen step
by step into her coach. Every one was laughing
at me, but I had no idea what it was for.</p>

<p class='c029'>“When we came home, the Queen sought out
my aunt, and seating herself on the bed, burst
into a loud laugh. ‘Lisette,’ said she, ‘has
made a delightful visit,’ and related all I had
done, which made the Electress laugh more than
her mother. ‘Lisette,’ said she, ‘you have
done right, and revenged us well on the haughtiness
of the Princess.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>This episode throws another side-light on
Mary’s reputation for pride, and her steady determination
in exacting all the respect due to her
rank—a determination which we see to be more
or less resented among her German relations.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>During the years that were yet to intervene
before the Restoration, Hyde himself was to
know little of peace. He was constantly on the
move, now with the King at Bruges, now obeying
a summons from the Princess Royal. His wife
was writing in 1657 and 1658 to John Nicholas,
on various domestic questions, yet always betraying
her disappointment at her husband’s
long absences and the uncertainty that attended
his return to her. The long and steady friendship
with the family of the Secretary extended
over a long term of years, and never failed until
death stepped in to close it.</p>

<p class='c012'>These letters were all written from Breda,
at the house where the Princess Dowager had
established the Hyde family, and the first which
now follows was addressed to Bruges.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<i>Sep. 20, 1657.</i></p>

<p class='c029'>“I take it for a very perticuler favour to finde

<p class='c011'>The next letter is addressed to Brussels, to
which place the Nicholas family had transferred
itself. Lady Hyde here makes allusion to one
of her children, Laurence, afterwards Earl of
Rochester, who seems to have become on his
own account a correspondent of John Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<i>16 May 1658.</i></p>

<p class='c029'>“I have many thankes to give you for your
care to me, and though it be longe, doe not forgitt
the civilitie of your letter to me w<sup>ch</sup> the
many indisposisons I have had sence my Lyeing

was in hopes to have bin w<sup>th</sup> you longe before

<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>keepes me still here, and now my Lord sends me
word that he will come hether, so that I am not
like to see you a great while, unlesse Mr Secretarey
please to make his way to Bruges whether
I here he intends to goe as soon as the Kinge is

and I know my Lady will dispense w<sup>h</sup> his absence
for a few days more. If my Lady your
Mother still want a waiteing woman, I can helpe
her to a prety younge maid, I beleave you may
know her mother, it is Mrs Gandye; now if
my Lady will doe an acte of Charity, I beleave
she will in a short time make her fitt for her
serv’ces but she is holy to be tought. I
can only commend her for a prety civil maid,
and truly I beleave her capable to learne.
She is about my haight and 16 yeares of
age. I would not write to my Lady about it,
because even you can tell better then I can,
whether this is fit proposition, all w<sup>ch</sup> I refere
to you and desire only this from you, that
you would not move it to my Lady, unlesse
you like it very well, for I tell you againe
she is to be maid a servant by those that
take her. Excuse this trouble with the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Lady Hyde seems to have been as eager to
supply her friends with servants as some of her
sisters in modern life, but laudably anxious to be
quite discreet in her recommendations.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the next letter, dated 27th May 1658, there
is an allusion to her eldest son Henry, who was
to succeed his father as second Earl of Clarendon
and who was at this time at Brussels under the
care of the Nicholas family. There is also mention
of little Frances, the younger daughter,
who seems to have come back to her mother’s
keeping recently from England (if she had been
left there). The remark as to her English
speaking points to this conclusion. But the
chief anxiety in the writer’s mind is the condition
of her father, Sir Thomas Aylesbury,
who was an inmate of her house, and then in
rapidly failing health.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are very much in the wright, I am not
yet so raidy, and if I were, should not use it
to my friends and perticulerly where I owe so
much as to your familey, and w<sup>th</sup> our acomplement
the blush would returne upon myselfe, if
I should forgitt to returne my thankes to you.
I am againe to thanke you for delivering my
message to Mr Secretarey, and upon my word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>both he and you s<sup>hd</sup> be very welcome if you
make Breda your way to Bruges. M<sup>rs</sup> Frances
will be able to make you speaches in English,
w<sup>h</sup> I am sure you will say is Language enough
for a woman, and if this will not bringe you, I
can say no more. I am glad my Husband hath
refused to lend his House at Bruges, it Lookes,
as you say, as if it shou’d returne, but of this I
know nothing, but I assure you I should have
great sattisfactione if it bringe me to my
Lady. I beleave indeed it is not possible for
you to guise at my Lord’s coming; I thinke
from the first weeke of my being brought to bed,
he hath promised to come to me, but now I will
not so much as thinke of it till I see him, though
he still says it will not be long before he come.
I wish I could tell you that my Father were well
but his sore mouth makes me much afraide of
him and yett to-day at present I thinke him
better than he was a week agoe; haveing latly
hard from Monsieur Charles I cannot but tell
you that he is well, and his dry Nurse assures
me he grows apace. Pray present my afectionat

I am to make no complaints, you may tell my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Hary I have not hard from his Father sence the
20. I wish it may prove a signe of your
removing towards Breda.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The succeeding letter, which is dated 3rd June
1658, contains an allusion to the siege of Dunkirk,
which had been invested on the 25th May by the
English and French forces under Turenne. The
Spanish army marched from Brussels to relieve
the town, and in this host were the Dukes of
York and Gloucester and the famous Condé,
who, however, was not allowed a free hand, for
it was against his advice that the Spanish Ambassador,
Don John of Austria, persisted in
giving battle. It was then that the Prince
said to the Duke of Gloucester: “Did you ever
see a battle fought?” and on the boy answering
that he had not, Condé<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> rejoined grimly, “Well,
you will soon see a battle lost.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>“This is to acknowledge yours of the 27. of
the last Month and to intreate you to returne
my humble serv’es to my Lady w<sup>h</sup> my thankes
for her willingness to receive a servant from me.
Pray assure her La<sup>sp</sup> I am very well sattisfied
with her reason in not taking another servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>at this time, and when I have the happiness to
see my Lady shall speake w<sup>th</sup> her more at large
of the person I would recomend to her. I am
very sorry the plague is feared at Bruges, and
much troubled for Dunquerque. I pray God
preserve them from the French. I hope you
will not be angry if I wish my Lady’s house at
Breda this sumer, upon my word I should looke
upon it as a great blessing to me. What the
people w<sup>th</sup> you intend, God knows, and though
I must submitt to my Lords businesse, I confesse
I am troubled that he is not now heare,
my Father being not like to recover, and wishing
every day to see my Husband, this will I hope
excuse my sad impatience. Pray my humble
serv’es to M<sup>r</sup> Secretary and tell him I doe still
hope to see him here as I do our souter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter of 6th June makes another reference
to Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are so great a courter that I could
quarrell w<sup>th</sup> you for useing me so like a strainger,
and you have forgotten my humor if you thinke
I expect it from my freinds. I am very glad
that you have some hopes of Mr Secretaries
cominge hether, pray present my humble serv’es
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to him and be sure you doe all good offeces
that may bringe him to Breda. If my Lady
Steephens can helpe my Lady your Mother to
a good waiteing woman and it be not inconvenent
to my Lady to take her I hope nothing I
have said shall hender her from it, for the Person
I proposed is to be maid usefull to my Lady by
her owne trouble in scatching and making her
fitt for her La<sup>ps</sup> serv’es, and therefore is not to
keepe her from a better. I only named this in
case there were not a better to be had and so
beseech you to lett my Lady know w<sup>th</sup> my most
affectionat and humble serv’es to her. Thay
say Dunquerque is releeved, but being but
Breda’s news I feare it, how ever I wish my
Lady a neerer neighbor and that it were in my
power to doe anything towards it that I might
inioye her La<sup>ps</sup> company. Sence I tould you
that I thought my Father was better, I have
bin in a great fright for him but I thanke God he
is now better and was this week tooke to take
the Ayre w<sup>ch</sup> I thinke hath don him goode, but
God knows he is brought very low, w<sup>ch</sup> keepes
me in continual fear for him though I am very
confident my Lord will come to Breda, and
beleave you thinke he will surprise me, yett the
people he hath to Leave w<sup>th</sup> are so unsertane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that it is imposible for me to beleave anything
of his coming tell I see him: my Father’s illnesse
makes me more impatient of his stay then
otherways I should be but I must submitt to
all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next letter of 13th June lays further
stress on Sir Thomas Aylesbury’s failing condition,
and there is an allusion which looks as
if little Frances Hyde were a special pet of the
Secretary’s.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You see how kind I am to myself in desiring
so good a family as yours neere me and I wish
w<sup>th</sup> all my heart it might be in my power to
serve my Lady if she should be put to a remove
I assure you none could w<sup>th</sup> greater alacrety
serve her then myselfe in the meane time, so if
my Lady have a mind to change the ayre I will
make her as good a conveniency w<sup>th</sup> me as I
can. I thanke you for the share you are pleased
to beare with us in our afflictions for my Father.
I am daly in great aprehensions of him yett at
present wee thinke him somthing better then
he was, pray give me your prayers for him; my
Lord hath againe given me hopes of seeing him
this weeke and by w<sup>t</sup> you say I should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>confident of it, but the King’s irresolution makes
me still in doubt. The sweete meate box w<sup>th</sup>
out asking any questions, is most freely at your
dispose. I will still hope to see Mr Secretarie
here, and so pray tell him with my most humble
serv’es and that his servant little Franke shall
eate cold puding with him for a wager, my
humble serv’es to my Lady your Mother when
you write, if you will excuse the hast of this
scribled paper. I shall not doubt of your
charity to</p>
<p class='c025'>“S<sup>r</sup> your most faithfull servant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All the letters show how much the movements
of the exiled King and his sister affected the
Hyde household at Breda, and Lady Hyde’s
comments betray a certain impatience and
irritation at the fact. It is evident that to some
extent she resented her husband’s constant
periods of absence, and scarcely considered them
necessary, though she saw nothing for it but
submission.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<i>June 27.</i></p>

<p class='c029'>“I am now doeing a thing I doe not love

but Hary calles a waye w<sup>ch</sup> must w<sup>th</sup> all other
faults excuse this hast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eldest son had returned, and his mother
in a letter of 5th August speaks as if his health
had been a matter of some anxiety.</p>

<p class='c015'>“By your last I was in hope you would have
bin at Hoochstraet in a very short time but Mr
Secretary’s last illnesse makes me doubt all
thoughts of that journey are Laid aside and
consequently that you will not come to Breda

goe into Holand for a weeke w<sup>th</sup> Mr Bealing.
I would not have given you the trouble of this
account, but that I know you are Hary’s friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Three days later, on 8th August, Lady Hyde
alludes to the great sorrow which has befallen
her in the death of her father, Sir Thomas Aylesbury,
who died as previously mentioned at the
age of eighty-one, surrounded by all the care
and affection his daughter could lavish on him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I doe acknowledge I am two Letters in your
dett the former of w<sup>h</sup> I had answered longe
before this but you know the sad conditione I
was in at this time w<sup>ch</sup> is so inst: an excuse and
to tell you the truth I am yett unfit for anything
else. I had sent you a chalinge while you were
at Antwerp for not gitting one day to come to
Miss Francesse, who is now al the merth of our
house, but in ernest I was in hope then to have
seene you, for I knew you were to returne to my
Lady when the Kinge did, she being so newly
come to a strange place which I have sent Mr
Secretary word hath maid his pease for the
present. From Hochstraet now is the place I
looke for to see you, by w<sup>ch</sup> time I hope my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Lady will thinke it fitt to take the Ayre, I can
say no more but assure you a harty wellcome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last letter to be transcribed, written on
29th September, is a short one.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am a gaine two Letters in your dett but
Downings’ disturbance was the cause w<sup>ch</sup> hath
kept me from acknowlideing my Lady’s favour
and reioycing w<sup>th</sup> you for Mr Secretary’s recovery,

be so quickely there, that I will say no more tell
I come, but intreate you to favour me w<sup>th</sup> my
humble serv’es to Mr Secretarey and my Lady
and your brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These letters give a fairly close impression of
the exiled Hyde household at the time when
that expatriation was drawing to its close. The
picture of Frances Hyde, the dutiful daughter,
the devoted wife, the affectionate mother, the
loyal friend, is a pleasant one, but one singular
point must be noted. There is no allusion to
the eldest daughter. And yet Anne, in attendance
on the Princess, must have been in constant
communication with her parents, both in person
and by letter.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Indeed there are four letters from Anne to her
father which, though undated as to the year,
may probably be placed in 1658 or 1659, towards
the end of her period of service.</p>

a letter from the Queen of Bohemia to Charles
may refer to something of the sort:</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>James</span>, the second son of Charles I. and Henrietta
Maria, was born on the 15th of October
1633, being baptized by Laud on the 24th,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
and like his elder brother was bandied about,
hither and thither, during the progress of the
great Civil War, in a manner and among associates
unlikely to have a satisfactory effect on
the character of a boy.</p>

D.D.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>It can scarcely be a matter for surprise that
it was so. The King, more and more harassed
and preoccupied as time went on, could hardly
be supposed to give adequate consideration to
his sons’ surroundings, although, as we have
seen, he did his best for the elder in committing
him to the guardianship of Edward Hyde.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1648 James was named Lord High Admiral
of England, a barren title in the state of affairs
as they then were, but before this he had passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>through some exciting adventures. He was in
Oxford when that loyal city surrendered to
Fairfax in 1646, two years earlier, and with his
sister Elizabeth and their little brother Henry
was taken to St James’s Palace, where they were
detained as wards of the Parliament. Although
the children’s intercourse with their father had
of late been of necessity intermittent,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> yet they
loved him very dearly, as he had been always
tender and indulgent to them. On this point
there is a pathetic story of James, at that time
but twelve years of age. For some time he had
been kept in ignorance of the King’s imprisonment,
but in January 1647 “one of his attendants,
a servant of the Earl of Northumberland,
told him of it, to which he replied, How durst
any rogues to use his Father after that manner!
and then fell a-weeping. The man told him he
would inform his Lord of what had been said,
whereupon the Duke took a long bow then in
the place to have shot him, had not another
behind him held his hand. For this it is reported
the Earl of Northumberland will have the
Duke whipped, but whether it hath been done
I know not.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>It is easy to picture the scene. The insolent
serving-man, “armed with a little brief
authority,” meanly rejoicing in the opportunity
to sting a fallen prince; and the boy, the
passionate tears still wet on his young, flushed
face, wild with indignant wrath at the bitter
news and his own helplessness. One cannot
bear to think that such hot, impetuous affection
and grief should have been so requited.</p>

<p class='c012'>The King, meanwhile, was very anxious to
effect the escape of his second son, whose life
as heir presumptive was of great importance,
and he confided the attempt to Colonel Charles
Bampfylde, or Bamfield, an Irishman. The
latter found a willing accomplice in Anne
Murray, the daughter of the King’s old tutor
and secretary, Thomas Murray, who afterwards
became Lady Halkett, and the two conspirators
laid their plans carefully, though it was May
1648 before the adventure could be accomplished.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

Charles II. thanked her for this service when they met at
Dunfermline.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The three children thus under ward at St
James’s were instructed to play at hide and seek
in the then neglected and thickly wooded garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of the ancient palace, and the young Duke James
proved himself quite sufficiently adroit in
seconding the plans of his preservers. Under
cover of the spring twilight he contrived to slip
through a gate purposely left open, which led
to the Tilt-yard—for Bampfylde had managed
to interest other sympathisers in the plot.
James had remembered also to lock the balcony
through which he emerged, and to throw away
the key, besides taking the precaution of locking
up his little dog in his room.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> By Tilt-yard end,
as it was called, Bampfylde was waiting for him
with a wig and patches, and they hurried forthwith
to Spring Gardens, “as if to hear the
nightingales,” a favourite expedition of the
London citizens at that season. Thence a coach
conveyed them to the river, where they took
boat at Ivy Bridge, and reached the “Old
Swan.” Here Mistress Anne Murray was waiting
for them, and she arrayed the boy in girl’s
clothes in all haste, while he, poor child, impatiently
adjured her: “Quickly, quickly,
dress me!” This done, Bampfylde took his
charge to the Lion Key, where a Dutch Pink,
cleared the day before by Gravesend searchers,
was expecting “Mr Andrews and his sister,” the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>latter supposed to be on her way to join her
husband in Holland.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here the Prince, waiting in the cabin, in a
moment of forgetfulness nearly wrecked the
whole situation by putting his leg on the table
to pull up his stocking, seeing which the barge-master
suspected the sex of the pretended girl.
However, Bampfylde’s threats and James’ promises
of future provision prevailed, and the
voyage was safely accomplished.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The fugitives landed in due course at Middleburg,
going thence to Dordrecht, and James,
having despatched Bampfylde to The Hague
to announce his successful escape, was met by
his brother-in-law the Prince of Orange, and by
him conducted to the Princess at Sluys. Bampfylde’s
influence appears to have been bad from
the beginning, as he tried to implicate the boy
in an act of treason.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Six ships of the fleet then
lying in the Downs deserted, and having secured
Deal, Sandown and Walmer, sailed to Helvoetsluys,
where James joined them, but Bampfylde
worked on the sailors to declare for the young
Duke without any mention of the King or the
Prince of Wales. James, however, was wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>enough to answer that he would be their admiral
only with his father’s consent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>At The Hague he joined his elder brother, and
early in the succeeding year set out for Paris,
starting on 6th January 1649, just when the war
of the Fronde was beginning. On this account
his mother sent letters to meet him at Cambrai,
bidding him delay his journey, and the Archduke
Leopold, Governor of the Netherlands,
offered him quarters in the Abbey of St Amand.
Here he stayed for about a month, a visit which
is supposed, in spite of his youth, to have laid
the foundation of his subsequent conversion to
the Church of Rome. The religious of this community
no doubt did their best in controversy
to influence the young English prince who might
one day prove a valuable asset. At some time,
probably soon afterwards, a nun is said to have
advised him to pray every day if he was not in
the right way, that God would show it to him,
and this seems to have made a deep and lasting
impression on his mind, judging from his allusion
to it many years later.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In February he was able to prosecute his
deferred journey, and on the 13th he made his
appearance at the Louvre where his mother then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>was. She was sitting at dinner when the boy
came hastily in and knelt for her blessing.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
What kind of reception she gave him we do not
know, but when all is said and done, Henrietta,
capricious as she could be, was an affectionate if
injudicious mother, and there must have been a
keen sense of satisfaction in receiving her young
son after their long separation and his adventurous
travels.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a time James settled down among his
hitherto unknown relations. The famous
princess, Anne Marie Louise d’Orléans, the redoubtable
heroine of the Fronde, “la grande
Mademoiselle,” was very kind to her new cousin
at a time when she was flouting his elder brother.
The Duke of York, between thirteen and fourteen
years of age, was then, she says, “very
pretty, well made, with good features, who spoke
French well, which gave him a much better
air than had the King his brother,” who was at
that time completely ignorant of the language,
though he was eagerly put forward by his
mother as a suitor for the hand of his imperious
cousin, who could bestow such a magnificent
dowry on any husband on whom her choice
might fall.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>In the September of 1649 Charles determined
to go to Jersey, the Channel Islands having
remained steadily loyal to the royal cause, and
he took his brother James with him, probably
intending to detach him from their mother’s
influence.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> At Caen they visited Lady Ormonde,
who was living there at that time in exile, and
at Coutances, not far away, the bishop received
the brothers with some distinction, giving a
banquet in their honour at Cotainville on the
following day. However, as the boats were
waiting, they started at once, and reached
Jersey on the 18th. Here they passed the
winter, and the Duke of York won golden
opinions from those who came in contact with
him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>He was by this time a tall slight boy, almost
as tall as his brother, lively and gracious in
manner, while his bright complexion and fair
hair displayed a marked difference from the
swarthy young King. The two were then in
mourning for their martyred father, whose tragic
death had taken place in the previous January,
and James is described as dressed “in an entire
suit of black without any other ornament or
decoration than the silver star displayed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>his mantle, and a purple scarf across his
shoulders.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The brothers were much together in those
early days of exile, and it could not be for the
advantage of the younger, seeing what manner
of men Charles chose to encourage about him,
though after all, considering his own youth and
circumstances, the latter was scarcely a free
agent in this respect.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two quarrelled at times, and indeed
somewhat later Charles manifested a certain
jealousy of his brother which can scarcely be a
matter for surprise.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of York in due time took service in
the army of France, under the great Turenne,
and speedily distinguished himself by his
courage and military genius,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> while the unhappy
King was forced to remain in obscure idleness
and abject poverty, an object of more or
less contempt in each country which he visited
in his wanderings, especially after that disastrous
attempt which ended in the crushing defeat of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Worcester—Cromwell’s “crowning mercy”—and
his own hairbreadth escape. James, on the
other hand, before he was twenty-one had seen
three victorious campaigns under his famous
leader, and was drawing pay which placed him
in easy circumstances, enabling him to support
his rank suitably. Nevertheless whatever
differences might arise between the brothers
(and these were certainly fomented by those
about them, not to speak of Cromwell, who from
motives of policy wished to divide them), there
was strong family affection among the children
of Charles I., and in later days these two were
certainly linked together by an unswerving
attachment which grew with advancing years,
and was dissolved only by death.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Charles had left Jersey in February 1650,
but his brother remained there, probably because
of the latter’s opposition to the treaty
with the Scots. Young as he was, he set himself
passionately against it, and even dismissed
Lord Byron and Sir John Berkeley from his
bedchamber on this account.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> However, the
brothers parted affectionately at this time, and
did not meet again for more than eighteen
months, Charles having joined his mother at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Beauvais, and then returned to Flanders. In
1650 Lord Taafe had proposed a match between
the Duke of York and the little daughter of
Duke Charles IV. of Lorraine, “a prince,” as
James remarked afterwards, “not much accustomed
to keep his word.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> However, the
young Duke seems to have acquiesced in the
plan, though the Queen was very angry with
both Taafe and Lord Inchiquin for presuming
to interfere, as she termed it. At this time her
relations with her second son were certainly
strained. She was very hard on him, and he
hated Henry Jermyn, hotly resenting the latter’s
powerful influence with his mother, who, he
declared, “loved and valued Lord Jermyn more
than all her children,” an instance of Henrietta’s
headstrong disregard for appearances, which
involved her in what was possibly an unmerited
scandal.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The poor boy had also at this time
the fret and strain of poverty, but just then
there came a report of the King’s death, on which
James set out for Brussels, where he stayed
at the house of Sir Henry de Vic. He remained
there for two months, frequenting, so we are told,
various popular churches for the sake, he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of the fine music he heard in them. At this
time Sir George Radcliffe was controller of the
Duke’s meagre household, and with Sir Edward
Herbert appointed a new suite. His mother
had forbidden him to join his sister Mary, but
in December 1650 he was allowed to proceed to
The Hague from Rheims, where he had gone
from Brussels. At the christening of the baby
William, born under such mournful circumstances,
the Princess Dowager proposed that the
young uncle should carry the child, but the
mother interfered, considering such a proceeding
highly insecure.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> James was made chief
mourner at the funeral of his brother-in-law,
the Prince of Orange, at Delft, but soon
afterwards the States General found him an
inconvenient visitor, as they were anxious to
establish a good understanding with the English
Parliament: thus he was sent to Breda, and
his mother was asked to recall him.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was with her in France at the time of his
brother’s absence in Scotland, and they went
together to Moriceux, to meet the fugitive King
on the accomplishment of his romantic escape
after Worcester. James was soon to make his
acquaintance with war on his own account, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>it was at the age of nineteen,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and therefore in
1652, that he entered the army of his cousin
Louis XIV., wherein he served four years
with honour, becoming popular with all ranks.
At the end of his fourth campaign, which included
the sieges and taking of Landrecy,
Condé and St Guislain, Turenne was sent for
by Mazarin, and as all the other lieutenant-generals
were on leave the young English prince
was for a time in supreme command of the
army of France.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> Before this, however, and
soon after he joined Turenne, the lad had received
his baptism of fire at the first attack on
Etampes, and it was there that Schomberg,
the future famous marshal, was wounded at his
side.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Forty years later at the Boyne Water,
King James, in the desperate attempt to regain
his lost crown, was defeated by the great Dutch
general, who fell in the hour of victory. Time
has his revenges. One wonders if the thoughts
of the luckless, despairing King travelled back
to that first fight, in the early flush of youth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>hope, when the world was opening before him
and everything seemed possible.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Soon after Turenne’s summons to attend the
Cardinal the treaty which Cromwell concluded
with France required the banishment of the
Duke of York, and having thus perforce to leave
the army, he came to Paris there to rejoin his
mother. He was smarting under the treatment
he had received, for Turenne was his ideal and
moreover had treated him with marked kindness
and consideration, giving “him a reception
suitable to his birth, and endeavoured by all
possible proofs of affection to soften the remembrance
of his misfortunes.” This great
leader had a high opinion of the Duke, saying of
him that he “was the greatest prince and like
to be the best general of his time.” We find
Clarendon himself writing to Secretary Nicholas
in 1653: “The Duke of York is this day gone
towards the field, he is a gallant gentleman and
hath the best general reputation of any young
prince in Christendom and really will come to
great matters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke had not reached manhood without
further plans on his mother’s part to negotiate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>a suitable alliance. We have seen that the
Lorraine match fell through. In the succeeding
year, when he was eighteen, Marie d’Orléans,
Mademoiselle de Longueville, the daughter of
the Duke de Longueville by his first wife, was
suggested by Sir John Berkeley. She was ugly
and deformed, though called a wise princess,
but the greatest heiress in France, after Mademoiselle
de Montpensier, and James made no
objection.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Hyde, however, opposed the
marriage, on the ground that the heir presumptive
ought not to marry before the
sovereign, in which axiom the queen-mother
for once agreed with him, and Anne of Austria,
Queen-regent of France, clinched the matter.
The Duke of York, she decided, was too great,
as the son of a king, to marry in France without
the consent of his nation and brother.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Mademoiselle
de Longueville married Henri, Duc
de Nemours, in 1657. Madame de Motteville
speaks of her good looks, which Hyde denies,
and affirms attachment on James’ part.</p>

<p class='c012'>James is reported to have been “very much
displeased,” which seems a little unlikely, considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>his youth and the unattractive appearance
of the proposed bride. But four more
years of strenuous life, as we know, were to
pass over his head, and then at Peronne, in the
train of his sister Mary, James, Duke of York,
was fated to meet for the first time Anne Hyde.
In his own memoirs, dictated long afterwards,
he acknowledges that he learnt to love her at
that time. The brilliant girl, for whom Spencer
Compton and Harry Jermyn had sighed in vain,
was, with her ready wit and hereditary talents,
a conspicuous figure in the entourage of the
Princess of Orange.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> “Besides her person,”
says the record just mentioned, “she had all
the qualities proper to inflame a heart less apt
to take fire than his.” “A very extraordinary
woman” she is even called by Burnet (who,
however, is not always to be trusted). But at
any rate, clever, fearless, ready of tongue and
broadly sympathetic, she stood for much that
might be considered typically English at that
time.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a> As for Anne’s own feelings, no one can
wonder at her reciprocation of a passion which a
prince like James laid at her feet. Fresh from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the fields of his prowess, confessed by the
greatest captain of the age to be of conspicuous
gallantry, and surrounded with the halo of
unmerited misfortune, there is no doubt that
he must have seemed a very Paladin to the
daughter of the loyal Cavalier to whom fealty
to the exiled race was a religion, and for the
rest, when one looks at the picture painted in
his youth by Lely—the haughty, beautiful face,
with its sensitive mouth and luminous eyes—one
cannot choose but see, like poor Nan Hyde,
in the Duke of York a veritable Prince Charming.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Princess Mary and her train remained for
some months in France, as before mentioned,
and it was during the stay in Paris that Frances
Stanhope, one of her ladies, was converted to
Rome, and Queen Henrietta was present at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>profession in the Jesuit Noviciate Church. At
this time the Queen’s capricious favour seems
to have veered in the direction of her second
son, probably on account of his service in the
French army.</p>

<p class='c012'>During this Paris visit Sir Richard Browne,
father-in-law to John Evelyn, was writing to
Hyde in the month of May: “I have as yett
been onely once at our Court where by misfortune
I could not kisse ye hande of y<sup>r</sup> faire
daughter.” They were old friends, and the
friendship lasted for years.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile the Duke of York, utterly weary of
inglorious ease, again took up arms, though
reluctantly, at this time in the Spanish army
under the exiled Condé. He had received a sort
of apology from Mazarin for the treaty with
Cromwell, which however he frankly acknowledged
to be unavoidable. It was, as has
already been said, a prime object with the Protector
to foment disagreements between the
royal brothers, and he persuaded the Cardinal
to offer James a command of troops in Italy.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Charles on this summoned his brother to Breda,
and bade him take an oath of service to Spain
and also dismiss his governor, Sir John Berkeley,
who was secretly an agent of Cromwell. The
Duke of York, however, probably resenting
dictation of any kind, left Flanders hurriedly,
to his brother’s great wrath; on which Hyde,
justly apprehensive of a breach between the two,
interfered on behalf of the younger brother,
begging that at any cost he should be recalled,
and Ormonde was sent after the truant. James
listened to his persuasions so far as to consent
to return, on condition that his household was
not meddled with, and the offending Berkeley
was given a peerage, it is hard to see why, being
created Baron Berkeley of Stratton. On this
occasion the Princess Mary went to Bruges to
assist in bringing about the reconciliation between
her brothers, and in the month of May
the Duke of York was given the command of
certain regiments newly raised, and in the
succeeding month finally made up his difference
with Charles. At the battle of the Dunes he
displayed extraordinary valour, a quality which
distinguished him throughout his career as a
soldier. Condé, who might certainly be considered
a judge of such matters, placed it on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>record that “if there was a man without fear,
it was the Duke of York.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In this campaign James had now the company
of his younger brother Henry, Duke of
Gloucester. In that poor boy’s short and stormy
life there was indeed little space for anything
to be called happiness. He, contemptuously
called “Master Harry” by his gaolers, had been
released by the Parliament some years previously,
and having landed at Dunkirk was first
sent to Lady Hyde at Antwerp, but he arrived
in Paris in 1653.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a> He had become—he was but
ten years old—terribly spoilt by bad company,
but he quickly improved in his new surroundings,
and later, Morley at any rate thought
highly of him.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> No sooner, however, had he
taken up his abode with his mother than she,
regardless of the dying commands of his father,
set to work with all her might to win him over
to the Church of Rome, fancying no doubt that
with a child of Gloucester’s tender years her
task would prove an easy one.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Charles II., nevertheless, wrote the boy a stern
letter of warning, and appealed passionately to
James for aid, he being then at hand, bidding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>him even leave the service of France sooner than
refrain from supporting his brother. Besides
this the King despatched the faithful Ormonde
to enforce his command, the latter moreover
on arrival finding it necessary to sell his own
George, the last jewel remaining to him, to help
the young Duke in his destitution.</p>

<p class='c012'>On this Henrietta flew into one of her tempests
of rage and promptly turned her youngest son
out of her house, believing she could thus coerce
him into surrender. After a piteous scene with
his little sister Henrietta, who seemed beside
herself with terror, only gasping “Oh me!
my mother!” amidst her sobs, the poor young
Duke, forlorn and helpless, but unshaken in his
resolve, fled to his brother James, who did his
best to console him, and proved indeed always
kind and affectionate. On this occasion, moreover,
the Duke of York attempted in vain to
soften his mother’s anger, but the only result
was that she refused to communicate with either
son, except through Walter Montague, who was
much in her confidence as a messenger and
go-between on many occasions. This favour he
probably owed to the fact of his being a convert
from the Anglican Church. He entered the
religious life, and died as Abbot of Pontoise.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The two royal brothers during their Paris
sojourn attended together regularly the English
service which was held at the house of Sir
Richard Browne and was frequented by many
of the exiled Cavaliers. If at this time James
had indeed begun to entertain doubts as to the
Church of his baptism, they were not yet strong
enough to lead him away from her worship. He
appears to have been instructed early in the
doctrines of the Church, especially in that of
the Real Presence, by Dr Steward, who was
successively Prebendary of Worcester and Provost
of Eton. During the progress of the war,
the latter became (nominally) Dean of St Paul’s
and of Westminster, and while Clerk of the Closet
to Charles I., was one of the commissioners at
the Treaty of Uxbridge. He also taught the
Prince of Wales, and became one of the Duke
of York’s Cabinet Council, Sir George Radcliffe
spitefully calling him “the heifer the queen
plowes with.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The support James gave to his
younger brother testifies to his loyalty, at any
rate for that time, and something also may
be due to the ardent veneration which the
memory of their father inspired in the children of
Charles I. To him the offices of his Church had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>been his stay and consolation up to the supremest
moment of the great tragedy, and his son could
not but remember the fact. And moreover it
must be recollected that among the many faults
of James, Duke of York, dissimulation had no
place. Even Burnet, though no friend to him,
could not but acknowledge him to be “candid
and sincere,” therefore we must conclude that
whatever difficulties may have presented themselves
to his mind, at the time when he and his
brother Henry knelt side by side at Mattins and
Evensong in Sir Richard Browne’s house, the
Duke of York was still conscientiously an
English churchman, and it is significant that in
after years he never tried to turn his daughters
from their faith.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>At the end of the campaign James had,
as in the case of the army of France, won
the confidence of his men and the respect
of Condé and of the Spanish leaders in
general.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It may be that neither England nor France
was in favour of the Princes taking service in
the Spanish army, a circumstance which would
have some force in determining James, who very
probably was quite willing to fling a defiance
in the teeth of Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, it is strange to find Sir John
Berkeley and Colonel Bampfylde, the plotter
of some years back, seriously discussing about
this time the question of a marriage for the Duke
of York with one of the Protector’s daughters,
a fact which goes to prove the despair of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Royalists of otherwise succeeding in England.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
Still later, in 1659, a party among the exiles,
choosing to believe a rumour which pronounced
the King to have consumptive tendencies and
to be in a precarious state of health, actually
proposed to set him aside in favour of his second
brother. There is not, however, a shadow of
evidence that James himself was in any way a
party to such a scheme. Indeed in August of
that year he followed Charles to France, and
later in the autumn the unlucky truce between
France and Spain put an end to the military
career of the Dukes of York and Gloucester, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>as a consequence deprived them of their pay in
the army of the latter country, throwing them
once more on their elder brother’s meagre resources.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r85'>85</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Eva Scott, “Travels of the King,” “The King in Exile.”</p>
<p class='c012'>In this connection a letter from Mr Jennings (Captain
Titus) to Hyde seems to point to the increasing arrogance
of the Protector’s family. Writing from Antwerp on 11th
February 1656-1657, he says: “There was lately a wedding
of a kinswoman of Laurence’s, whither all the grandees and
their wives were invited, but most of the Major-Generals
and their wives came not. The feast wanting much of its
grace by the absence of those ladies, it was asked by one
there, where they were? Mrs Claypole answered: ‘I’ll
warrant you washing their dishes at home, as they use to do.’
This hath been extremely ill taken, and now the women do
all they can with their husbands to hinder Mrs Claypole from
being a Princess and her Highness” (Clarendon State
Papers). It will be remembered that Elizabeth Claypole,
Cromwell’s favourite daughter, predeceased him by a few
weeks.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>When Henry had been sent out of England
by the Parliament, that body had promised the
prince a small maintenance, provided he kept
away from all and any of his relations, a proviso
which obviously was unlikely to be observed.
However, any such provision was forfeited,
and he was in the same plight as his next
brother.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another effort at an English alliance was made
during this year, Lord Mordaunt suggesting
this time, as a bride to the Duke of York, Fatima
Lambert, the only child of the famous Roundhead
general, whose influence was for a time
paramount with the army since the death of the
Lord Protector in September of 1658.</p>

<p class='c012'>James, however, now pledged secretly to
Anne Hyde, at once refused the proposed match,
alleging as a reason the want of the King’s consent,
but still keeping his secret inviolate.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Secretary Nicholas’ letter to Charles
II., dated 8th October, it appears that in his
communication with the Duke, Lord Mordaunt
did not mention the name of the lady, but called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>her mysteriously “a daughter of a gentleman
of power and good quality in England, but he
was not to tell who it was,” which seems an
unmeaning precaution, as sooner or later James
must have been told, and could not be expected
to pledge himself in ignorance of the lady’s
parentage.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>However, as we know, the negotiation, if it
attained such a point, speedily fell to the ground,
and events which soon followed removed it
altogether out of the sphere of possibilities.</p>

<p class='c012'>In that year, when hope and fear alternated
almost daily, when events crowded on each
other, Lambert’s restless figure holds the stage
in one aspect or another.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> In the autumn he is
sent with a strong force to suppress the rising
of Sir George Booth, who is taken in the endeavour
to escape in a woman’s dress, and Lord
Derby in the disguise of a servant. Lambert
is to command the Parliament’s forces in the
north in October. In March of the next year
the pendulum has swung back, and the victorious
general is committed to the Tower. He is
released on parole, but once more he is stirring
up strife and is made prisoner. Later, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>narrowly escapes the block, to be a captive for
his life in Guernsey. But now another figure
dominates the arena, and it is Monk who gathers
up all the threads into his strong hands, who
takes the tide at the turn, who grasps the empty
crown which a greater than he had longed but
feared to wear, and lays it at the feet of the exile

<p class='c012'>In the early spring of 1660, the year which was
to see the end of King Charles’ dreary, aimless
wanderings, the Duke of York was made
captain-general of all the Spanish forces at sea,
and “admiral of his fleets commanding his
cinque-ports,”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> but he had not time to enjoy
these dignities long, for in the month of May he
came home once more with his brothers, and
was forthwith made admiral of the English fleet.
Hyde had been strongly opposed to the Spanish
appointment as it was supposed to involve the
profession of the faith of Rome, but at that
moment the fortunes of the royal house were at
their lowest ebb. Charles himself had gone
incognito to Calais, James to Boulogne, hoping
for the success of Booth’s attempt, but its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>failure already mentioned sent both the brothers
back to Brussels.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Only in March, came Bailey secretly to
Ormonde with the tale that the King was toasted
in the taverns of London. Only in March, and
in May the <i>Royal Charles</i> was bringing him back
to his inheritance, the Duke of York sailing in
the <i>London</i>, the Duke of Gloucester in the
<i>Swiftsure</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>The 29th of May—Oak-Apple Day—the day
looked for through long years of suspense, the
day almost despaired of, the day welcomed
with a very agony of joy and exultation, had
come at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>To understand the fervour of welcome that
greeted the restored King, we must consider the
unhealed wounds suffered by the many, and the
fact that the religious life of a great and representative
class was inextricably bound up with
the fortunes of the exiled race. In the eighteen
years which had passed since the Standard was
set up at Nottingham, castle and grange and
manor—yes, and farmhouse too—had sent forth
their sons, ungrudgingly for the most part, to
fight under that banner, and the great Anglican
Church, with her array of saintly doctors, never
more conspicuous than in that age, had given her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>blessing on the enterprise. In either case the
sacrifice had been exacted, the soldier had laid
down his life, the priest had suffered for the
cause, and above all the scaffold before Whitehall
had for ever set the seal on both. It was
nothing that England had known years of
strong, heavy-handed government, that she had
dictated terms to other nations. To many who
cherished sorrowful memories, those years only
represented a space of stern tyranny and repression,
and the graves of the beloved slain
at Edgehill and Newbury, Marston Moor and
Naseby, were green for ever in their hearts.
To such simple and devout souls, also, it was
much that through that time the Liturgy had
been forbidden, that the churches had been
desecrated, that the whole land lay desolate,
neither could she “enjoy her Sabbaths.” To
them it was much that the end had come, and
even with haunting memories of the past they
could say it was worth while. If there was
much that was short-sighted in this position,
there was also much that was heroic.</p>

<p>JAMES, DUKE OF YORK</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>So in the sunshine of spring, an English spring
with the laburnums and lilacs ablow, with the
air scented with the breath of flowers, alive with
the singing of birds, the King came “to his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>again.” Thanksgivings had been offered in the
glorious cathedral of Canterbury, Rochester had
added to the welcome, and now on Restoration
Day a gallant train rode slowly over Blackheath
on its triumphant way to London. Blare of
trumpet and ring of bridle-chains and a riot of
colour were all combined, while the people who
lined the way could, some of them, scarcely see,
for their blinding tears, the dark-faced King,
thirty years old to-day, glancing quickly around
him, the saturnine mouth relaxed in a smile, as
he bowed to right and left. No wonder that he
could remark with easy cynicism that no doubt
it must be his own fault that his coming had
been so long delayed, since everyone was so
glad to see him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just behind the King came his brothers, side
by side.</p>

<p class='c012'>As James, Duke of York, reined his fretting
horse with practised skill, he looked in his costly
attire a very comely prince in the eyes of his
brother’s lieges. Yellow ribbons were fluttering
from his shoulders, fleecy white plumes waved
from his hat over the long brown curls which
framed the proud and handsome face. He was
now twenty-six, already a soldier of tried
capacity, and as one of the Intelligencers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>London had already said of him, “cried up for
the most accomplished gentleman both in arms
and courtesie that graces the French Court.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
So people wrote and thought, yet this reputation
was for the most part left behind him when he
crossed the Channel.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f90'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r90'>90</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Queen Anne and her Court,” P. F. Williams Ryan.
“The Duke of York, besides being an able Captain and
successful administrator, was a man of many accomplishments,
acquired by association with the most polished society
of Western Europe.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It was the fate of James Stuart, as it has often
been the fate of obscure persons, just to miss the
appreciation which in some measure he really
deserved. His elder brother’s careless good
humour and the grace of manner which concealed
so much selfish indifference won for
Charles II. from his people, weary of long
repression and smarting under unwelcome conditions,
an amount of real affection which was
certainly both unreasonable and undeserved,
but which nevertheless lasted for his lifetime,
and made him one of the most popular sovereigns
of his country.</p>

<p class='c012'>James, on the other hand, because he lacked
just those superficial attributes was, to the bitter
end, mistrusted and misunderstood. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>not clever in any sense, possessing none of the
brilliant gifts which Charles misused and flung
away with absolute recklessness; but as Buckingham,
with his rapid, mordant apprehension, once
said of the brothers: “The King (Charles II.)
could see things if he would, and the Duke would
see things if he could.”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f91'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r91'>91</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bishop Burnet’s “History of My Own Time.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>If he could—there was the key of the whole
position. When the supreme moment of his
life arrived, James proved absolutely blind to
the issues involved—he could not see.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to his better qualities, Bishop Burnet, as
already mentioned at no time a friend to the
Duke of York, was forced to admit his personal
courage. “He was very brave in youth, and
so much magnified by Marshal Turenne, that
till his marriage he really clouded the King, and
passed for the superior genius.” Also it is acknowledged
that he was “a firm friend till affairs
and his religion wore out all his first principles
and inclinations.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That same grace of constancy in friendship
is endorsed by all his biographers, and unhappily
it was in many cases to prove his undoing. He
could not withdraw his confidence once given,
and he was utterly blind to the faults of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>friends, clinging to them through good and evil
report, and in this respect he must be cleared of
the charge of fickleness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Presently we shall see how this insensate
belief in his friends, and misapprehension of
their motives, was to operate in the drama of
his marriage, which was nearly thereby shipwrecked.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had no gifts as a letter writer (in which
capacity Charles II. certainly excelled, judging
from the correspondence which survives<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a>) and
in speech he even stammered slightly, for which
reason he was habitually silent. But while
Charles was incurably idle, letting life drift by
on the surface of a jest, and unutterably bored
whenever he was forced to work (though no
man knew better how to apply when put to
it), James was plodding, methodical, diligent,
though he got little credit for it, then nor
later.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f92'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r92'>92</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Granger’s “Biographical History of England.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>This difference, apart from diversity of temperament,
may be partly accounted for by the
circumstances of the brothers’ early life. Charles
during his years of exile was for the most part
condemned to inaction, while James gained in
the arena of European warfare, under the eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the greatest generals of his day, the habit
of action and of eager disposal of his time.</p>

<p class='c012'>One more contrast is to be noted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles deliberately allowed himself to sink
deeper and deeper into the mire of degrading
vice, successfully stifling the voice of his conscience,
till to all appearance it ceased to
trouble him. James, on the other hand, greatly
as he had shared in the prevailing sins of his age,
never lost the uneasy sense of remorse, and
certainly for the last fifteen years of his life
tried to atone for his stained youth by fervent
and real penitence. Moreover it is to be
reckoned in his favour that he never tolerated
any sneers at religion in his presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the rest, he loved England with even
passionate fervour. To his dying day he
steadily and enthusiastically extolled his fellow-countrymen,
banished though he was from the
land that was so dear to him; nor could he
refrain from sympathetic admiration of his
English sailors for their daring gallantry at La
Hogue, a gallantry displayed as it was against
himself, when with the navy of France he made
one more fruitless attempt to regain his lost
kingdom.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Grammont, gay, careless, superficial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>was yet able to sum up the character of
the Duke with unusual gravity and deliberation.
He bore the “reputation of undaunted courage,
inviolable attachment for his word, great
economy in his affairs, hauteur, application,
arrogance, each in their turn, a scrupulous
observer of the rules of duty and the laws of
justice; he was accounted a faithful friend
and an implacable enemy.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Lastly, let it be said of James Stuart that he

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>It</span> is difficult, nay impossible, now to fix the

between the Duke of York and Anne
Hyde.</p>
<p class='c012'>Macpherson places it in 1657. James, he
says, “had fallen in love with Anne when the
Chancellor and he were on ill terms,”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> but the
probabilities point to the Paris visit already
described. This would give a reason for the
Prince’s lingering on in the French capital at
that time, for he appears then to have been
treated by the Court of France with very little
consideration, a state of things which he was
by no means the person to endure meekly, proud
and punctilious as he could show himself to be.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>It was, by the way, then—if at all—that his

younger Harry Jermyn, formerly a suitor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Nan herself, though the fact of such a union is

</div>

<p class='c012'>However, James himself acknowledges that
it was when the Princess and her train came to
Paris that he was first attracted to the young
maid of honour. He says that she brought
“his passion to such an height as between the
time he first saw her and the winter before the
King’s restoration he resolved to marry none
but her, and promised to do it, and though at
first when the Duke asked the King his brother
for his leave, he refused and diswaded him from
it, yet at last he opposed it no more, and the
Duke married her privately, owned it some time
after, and was ever after a true friend to the
Chancellor for several years.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>We are here given a period between the
summer of 1656 and the winter of 1659-1660.
As we know that the Duke’s campaigning had
taken him away from Paris in the autumn of
1657, the assumption is that some sort of pledge
passed between the lovers before this time, and
that they had then parted for some years with
the knowledge of their jealously guarded secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>confined to themselves alone. No one seems
really to have suspected the truth till long
afterwards, though there is a despatch dated
the 7th or 17th of August 1656 which has been
supposed to refer to this love affair, though it
is hard to say on what grounds the supposition
is founded. The letter is from Ross to Secretary
Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In England there is much bustle about
choosing Parliament men. Some counties have
chosen Bradshaw, Ludlow, Salloway, Harrison
and Rich, at which Cromwell is so incensed that
he has ordered them to give bail to the majors
general of their counties. My wife is going to
Dover to get a conveyance to go to the Duke
of York. I hear from young Musgrove that Mrs
Benson is become ward to a physician who lately
applied to the Princess Royal to board with her
and one Bronkard who is with her and they are
to go with her on her next journey and be spies
on the King’s deportment.”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is said that “Benson” is cypher for the
Duke of York. Query, is Mrs Benson intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>for Anne Hyde? The date makes this supposition
unlikely. Even had there been any inkling
of the affair it could scarcely have been so soon,
and such a storm of wrath was evoked by the
discovery of the contract in 1660 that it is most
improbable that any suspicion of it was afloat
four years earlier.</p>

<p class='c012'>Too many people were interested in so vital
a question for the secret to have been quite
closely kept in such a case. It would have
leaked out somehow, a whisper here, a hint
there, to ears only too ready to listen to so choice
a morsel of scandal, from lips equally ready and
eager to retail it. It is at least certain that for
long after the Paris visit Anne retained the affection
and confidence of the Princess of Orange,
and we know that these were rudely shaken by
the discovery when it was made.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In some respects it is fairly easy to reconstruct
the London of the earlier Stuarts.
Here and there one can trace, by the help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of main thoroughfares, the sites of buildings
once famous, though now either substantially
changed or altogether non-existent. The south
side of the Strand in those days was lined with
large and stately houses, mansions in the true
sense, each with its façade facing the street;
and to the rear its shady garden reaching to the
river, where the water-gate with its elaborate
ironwork and lofty flanking pillars gave access
to a flight of steps, where a boat was commonly
moored. The Thames was then the chief and
favourite highway of the city. Its shining surface
was for the most part alive with craft of
every description, from the royal barge, gaudy
with profuse gilding and silken hangings, to the
small boat darting hither and thither, and holding
perhaps but a single passenger. Heavy
loads would be going slowly down to Greenwich
or Gravesend, a boat full of cheerful citizens
with violins on board rowing up to Chelsey
Reach, a market woman or two with their
baskets crossing over from the fields beyond
the Tabard on the south side, a Templar embarking
at Whitehall stairs to hurry down to
Alsatia—it was all a feast of colour and life,
such as, in one sense, has passed away from the
scene for ever.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>One of the great houses occupying such a
position was that known as Worcester House.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
It had been originally a residence of the bishops
of Carlisle, and it stood on the site of the present
Beaufort Buildings, between the Savoy and
Durham Place. At the Reformation it became
the property of the Crown, and was granted to
the founder of the Bedford family, when it was
known as Bedford House, till they removed to
the present Southampton Street and built there
another Bedford House.</p>

Past and Present”; Walford, “Old and New London.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The house in the Strand then passed to Edward,
second Marquess of Worcester, the loyal
Cavalier who held his strong castle of Raglan so
stoutly for the King, and who is, as well, remembered
for his “Century of Inventions”
and his numerous scientific experiments. He
died in 1667, and his son Henry being created
Duke of Beaufort in 1682 gave that name to the
block of houses now occupying the site. During
the Commonwealth, the house had been used
for committees and was furnished by the Parliament
for the Scottish Commissioners. At one
time Cromwell himself had lived there,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>May 1657 a Bill was passed to settle it on
Margaret, Lady Worcester. The Somersets
having regained possession of their house, Lord
Worcester, twelve days after the Restoration,
offered it rent free to Edward Hyde, who, however,
agreed to a lease at five hundred pounds
a year, looking on it merely as a temporary
house, intending to build for himself; an intention
to be fulfilled before much time was
past.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Here for the present, at any rate, the Chancellor,
who had accompanied his master on his
triumphant return, took up his abode.</p>

<p class='c012'>The pageant of the Restoration was possessing
fully the mind and temper of the people. The
streets were daily thronged with eager, excited,
jubilant crowds, demonstrating their noisy welcome
to the long expatriated King. London
was delirious for the time being with the revulsion,
and those who had endured years of exile
and poverty were not the least happy. Among
these might be numbered the Hydes. The
Chancellor might certainly be considered to
deserve a season of rest and prosperity after
so many strenuous years of service, and as soon
as the King was at Whitehall, firmly established
in the house of his fathers, Hyde had leisure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>turn to his own affairs, and forthwith sent off
for his daughter Anne. It has been said that
the Princess Mary’s suspicions had been already
aroused with regard to her brother James and
her maid of honour, and that she had therefore
dismissed the latter from her service, but if so
it does not seem that she imparted such suspicions
to any one at that time, for certainly
Hyde himself was then completely ignorant of
them. He was, as we have seen, a man of strong
and tenacious family affections, and for his
elder girl he had a deep and enduring love.
“She being his eldest child he had more
acquaintance with her than with any of his
children.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Besides, another question with
regard to her was beginning to occupy his mind.
Now that public affairs were settling down
peaceably in England, he bethought him of
finding an honourable establishment for his
Nan, and it seems he had “an overture from a
noble family.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Since the quickly extinguished love affairs
at The Hague in 1654-1655 nothing of the kind
is recorded, and the Chancellor was fully alive
to the advisability of a suitable marriage for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>this his elder daughter, who was now twenty-three,
a mature age according to the ideas of
the time. Back, therefore, to England and to
the new home in London, came Anne Hyde, a
stranger to her native land since her childhood,
to be received by her parents with exceeding
joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, no doubt, to many of the long exiled
Cavaliers a summer of hope, destined, in many
cases, to be unfulfilled. They looked forward
eagerly to the knitting together of ravelled
skeins, to the renewal of old ties, of old friendships;
to the building up of home in the dear
familiar places so long laid waste and desolate.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Edward Hyde and Frances his wife looked
forward fondly to welcoming their Nan, and
cherished happy visions of a blithe bridal, of a
new relationship, new ties; of children’s children
at their knees in God’s good time.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were keeping open house like their
neighbours with lavish hospitality, and perhaps
Mistress Anne, in spite of the possession of her
momentous secret, and the anxiety inextricable
from it, was not averse to the intercourse now
opened with the choicest spirits of that English
society which was re-forming itself around her.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the wainscotted rooms of Worcester House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>they were made welcome. Ormonde, tried
and trusted, who had watched over the boyhood
and shared the exile of his king with selfless
devotion; and Southampton, whose memory
could go back to the awful night, when he was
keeping his vigil by the body of his dead king in
St James’s, and the muffled figure of Cromwell
stole into the dusky room to look at the calm
face of his victim; and Edward Nicholas, the
Secretary, of whom it could be said that there
was “none more industrious, none more loyal,
none less selfish than he.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> These with their
host could talk over the days of strife and confusion,
of rebellion and anarchy, wherein they
had played their parts; days past, so all trusted,
never to return. Together they could speak
with hushed and saddened voices of lost friends
and of the master whom they had served so
faithfully, yet failed to save. There, too, often
came John Evelyn, a friend true and loyal
through long years. “This great person,” he
says, speaking of Hyde, “had ever been my
friend.” He would come by water from his
house at Deptford—that Sayes Court near which
he was afterwards to discover the young Gibbons
at work on his great carving—and so, landing at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the water-gate, would pass through the garden
into Worcester House. And there likewise
would be Morley, now Dean of Christ Church
(who had come back before the Restoration,
being sent by Hyde to contradict the report of
the King’s apostacy), taking up once more the
threads of the close friendship of many years.
Perhaps, too, Gilbert Sheldon, who had gone
joyfully to meet the returning king at Canterbury—now
Dean of the Chapel Royal, but soon
to be Bishop of London—was there also, ready
for an argument or dispute with Morley, yet
both of them united in virtue of long-standing
affection for the Chancellor.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a> And among them
would be other and younger guests: gallants
scented and curled, in lace and satin, playing the
courtier to the daughters of the house, Anne and
even little Frances, or laughing with their young
brothers, or, one of them, singing a dainty
madrigal or so to the music of a lute or virginals.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was to all seeming a happy, sunny time, but
suddenly into the midst of the cheerful trifling
was flung an announcement which was to prove,
with a vengeance, an apple of discord to all
whom it could concern.</p>

<p class='c012'>James, Duke of York, the King’s second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>brother, the heir presumptive to the Crown,
and the Chancellor’s elder daughter, Mistress
Anne Hyde, were married, and every one,
whether remotely interested or no, stood
aghast.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the Duke first spoke to his brother on
the subject is doubtful,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> but according to his
own memoir it seems to have been before the
Restoration, possibly even at the time of the
projected match with Fatima Lambert, though
as we have seen he did not openly give it as a
reason for his refusal.</p>

York’s marriage with Mrs Hyde.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Easy-going as Charles II. was on some points,
he was naturally strongly opposed to such a
marriage for his brother as one with the Chancellor’s
daughter, since no possible advantage
could result from it, and later, when he did
give his consent, he only reluctantly withdrew
his opposition.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless James disregarded the fraternal
disapprobation, without at the time confessing
the fact, for the marriage on which so much was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to hang took place at Breda on 10th November
1659.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Princess of Orange and her three brothers
were there alternately with Brussels throughout
that winter and the early part of the succeeding
spring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thurloe writes in March 1659-1660: “To-morrow
I am parting for Antwerp, whither the
princess royal is going, being on her return
from Breda. The King of Scots goes with her
to Antwerp, and from thence returns specially
hither, but both the dukes go through with her
to Breda.”<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a> It is certain that though Mary
was ignorant of the marriage she suspected the
existence of some understanding between her
brother and the maid of honour before the end
of 1659, and on this account made no difficulty
of the latter’s retirement from her service.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a consensus of evidence as to the date
of the marriage. Among others, Lady Fanshawe
gives it.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a> She was certainly in Holland

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Who the witnesses of this union were cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>now be ascertained, and it may be because of this
fact that we are told that James could, if he
chose, have had the contract annulled at the
time when the storm broke.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a> It has indeed by
some writers been termed a contract, only, of
marriage, but we shall see later that the
validity was fully established.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>At any rate James now went to the King, and
on his knees made a clean breast of the affair,
confessing the fact of his marriage in defiance
of the prohibition of the previous year, and
entreating permission for a public ceremony.
Charles was, we are told, “greatly troubled with
his Brother’s Passion,” “which was expressed
in a very wonderful manner and with many
tears, protesting that if his Majesty should not
give his consent, he would immediately leave the
Kingdom, and must spend his life in foreign
parts.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The King, as might be expected, was greatly
dismayed and perplexed, as the situation offered
serious complications. He does not appear to
have shown then, nor later, much positive anger
with his brother, but he was far-seeing enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>to fear the difficulties that would probably arise
from this unwelcome alliance, which might
very well prove a terrible stumbling-block in
his way.</p>

<p class='c012'>James meanwhile was vehement and determined.
As to his threat of self-expatriation,
that was of course not to be thought of for a
moment, and the King in his perturbation sent
for the Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably Charles’ first feelings with regard
to Hyde were those of strong irritation, as it
might easily transpire that the latter from
motives of ambition had, if not assisted, at
least countenanced the match.</p>

<p class='c012'>However those old and tried friends, Ormonde,
the new Lord Steward, and Southampton, now
Lord High Treasurer, were deputed to see and
confer with him first, before his interview with
the King himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hyde’s outburst of wrath and bitter grief on
being told the news<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> satisfied all parties that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>there was no collusion on his part, and when
Charles himself came into the room, he was
softened by the father’s evident distress, and
spoke gently and kindly to his old servant.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f113'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r113'>113</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“The Chancellor knew nothing of the Duke of York’s
marrying his daughter” (Macpherson Papers).</p>
<p class='c012'>“Nobody was so surprised and confounded as the Chancellor
himself, who, being of a nature free from jealousy,
and very confident of an entire affection and obedience from
all his children, and particularly from that daughter whom
he had always loved dearly, never had in the least degree
suspected any such thing, though he knew afterwards that
the Duke’s affection and kindness had been much spoken
of beyond the seas, but without the least suspicion in anybody
that it could ever tend to marriage” (“Life of
Edward, Earl of Clarendon: Continuation,” by himself).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of York himself next made his
appearance, but possibly the King, wishing to
avoid a scene, or not thinking the moment a
propitious one for his brother to attempt any
justification, took the latter away with him,
leaving Hyde for the present with his friends,
who for their part did their best to console
him. They for one thing strenuously upheld
the fact of the marriage, of which the Chancellor,
in his pain and bewilderment, was at first doubtful,
and indeed urged every ground of comfort.
For the time being, however, the angry father
would listen to no argument nor representation.
Hurrying home he ordered his daughter into
close confinement, in the high-handed fashion
which parents in those days were in the habit of
employing. He really seems, moreover—the
grave, sedate, well-balanced Chancellor—to
have taken leave of his senses, for he even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>seriously suggested sending the culprit to the
Tower, not to mention the extreme measure of
cutting off her head. Southampton, in his
dismay at his old friend’s frenzy, had told the
King that it must be madness in some form,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
saying that “His Majesty must consult with
soberer men, that He” (pointing to the Chancellor)
“was mad, and had proposed such
extravagant things that he was no more to be
consulted.” However, without any question
of Tower or block, Mistress Anne was locked
up in her father’s house, and apparently was
destined to remain in durance. Finding the
rigorous treatment which, as it was, Hyde
chose to adopt, the King again sent for him,
and taking him to task for his harshness, interceded
for the offending daughter. The Chancellor,
however subservient he could be, was not
to be coerced on such a point, and stood firm.
He answered proudly, that “her not having
discharged the duty of a daughter ought not to
deprive him of the Authority of a Father, and
therefore he must humbly beg His Majesty not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to interpose his commands against his doing
anything that his own dignity required; that
He only expected what His Majesty would do
upon the Advice He had humbly offered to
him, and when He saw that He would himself
proceed as He was sure would become him.”
Charles, for his part, accepted this snub direct
with perfect docility, but the plot was destined
to thicken quickly, and neither of them could,
as it turned out, prevent the march of events,
nor sever the offending pair.</p>

History”).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In spite of her father’s vigilance, the Duke of
York found means to visit his wife during her
incarceration, by the connivance of her maid,
Ellen Stroud, who had been a confidante from
the beginning.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Clarendon in his own Memoir
uses the words: “By the administration of
those who were not suspected by him, and who
had the excuse that they ‘knew that they
were married.’” One other accomplice there
seems to have been.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a> It is almost certain that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the girl’s mother was in the plot, though how far
must be a matter of conjecture, but before the
esclandre Sir Astley Cooper, after dining at
Worcester House, said to Lord Southampton,
who was also present, that he was certain that
Mistress Anne was the wife of either the King
or the Duke of York, judging by her mother’s
demeanour. This, it seemed, displayed the
scarcely veiled consideration due to the new
rank, and an eager expectation of the moment
when concealment would be no longer necessary.</p>

home Sir Anthony said: ‘Yonder Mrs Anne is certainly
married to one of the brothers: a concealed respect (however
 suppressed) showing itself so plainly in the looks, voice
and manner wherewith her mother carved to her or offered
her of every dish, that it is impossible but it must be so’”
(“Samuel Pepys and the World he Lived In.” Wheatley).</p>
<p class='c012'>“Lord Shaftesbury told Sir Richard Wharton, from whom
I had it, that some time before the match was owned, he
had observed a respect from Lord Clarendon and his lady
to their daughter that was very unusual from parents to
their children, which gave him a jealousy she was married
to one of the brothers, but suspected the King most.” As
far as one can judge, Clarendon himself was ignorant.
(Burnet’s “History of His Own Time,” Lord Dartmouth’s
Notes.)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It is scarcely to be wondered at. Frances
Hyde may have been prompted by ambition,
or simply by the desire to give her daughter her
heart’s desire without counting the cost or considering
the consequences. In either case it is
hard to blame her, though her connivance places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>her on a lower plane than her husband, with his
high ideals of what was due to the royal house,
exaggerated as the feeling might be which made
him say that sooner than see her wife of the
Duke, “I had much rather see her dead, with
all the infamy that is due to her presumption.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet fate was too strong for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was very likely easy enough for mother
and bower-maid to arrange the stolen meetings
of the two, when we recollect the position of
Worcester House.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was quite simple, in the velvet darkness of
a summer night, for the prince to come down in
a wherry from Whitehall stairs to the water-gate
of the Chancellor’s house, which he would find
unlocked, and so pass through the silent garden
where only the whisper of the leaves stirred in
the light wind fitfully, piloted by Ellen the maid,
to the room where Mistress Nan herself was
waiting to keep tryst. No one else need be the
wiser—no one else knew, save Lady Hyde, and
she would keep out of the way carefully.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was no doubt a halcyon time, that summer
of the Restoration, for many pairs of lovers,
joined after long sundering to make reunion all
the dearer; and to Anne Hyde it was gilded
twofold. Love triumphant burnt in a clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and steady flame, and besides, there was the
dazzling promise of splendour and royalty.
The moments hurried by all too swiftly in the
starlight. If his tongue was, as we are told,
slow and halting, hers was ready and swift,
and there was, at any rate, the eloquence of
clasped hands, of eager eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>But matters were not to arrange themselves
quite happily at present, and the threads of the
puzzle would need a very careful disentangling
before the cord would straighten out quite
smooth and even.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rumour had begun to be busy. Gossips
talked of a contract. Pepys, who is never
very accurate, and who moreover constantly and
unaccountably betrays a prejudice against the
lady, calls it a promise, only, of marriage.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

Lord Braybrooke, 1906.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>He gives the story that James, after the time-honoured
manner of the hero of melodrama, had
signed this promise with his blood, that Anne
had carefully locked it up but that the Duke
had found means to get this important paper
“out of her cabinet,” that the King wanted his
brother to marry her but that the latter “will
not.” This remark about the King, by the way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>puts the account out of court. Sir John Reresby,
more good-natured but scarcely better informed,
says the marriage or betrothal probably took
place either in January or February 1660, soon
after James returned to Flanders on the failure
of Booth’s rising. We have, however, much
more definite evidence. In the deposition on
oath of the parties, to be noticed presently, the
word contract is certainly used, and the expression
had to be defined. We shall see in what
manner this was done.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is clear that the King very quickly made
up his mind to countenance the marriage. He
said to Hyde himself that his daughter “was
a Woman of a great Wit and excellent parts,
and would have a great power with his brother,
and that he knew she had an entire obedience
for him her Father, who he knew would always
give her good counsel by which he was confident
that naughty people which had too much credit
with his brother and which had so often misled
him, would be no more able to corrupt him, but
that she would prevent all ill and unreasonable
attempts, and therefore he again confessed
that he was glad of it.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

by himself.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>This was, of course, a tribute to the Chancellor
himself. Charles II. was fully conscious of
how much he had owed for many years to the
counsels and service of Hyde, and how important
they were likely to prove in the future;
therefore his chief anxiety, at that time at any
rate, was to bind the latter’s interests to his
own at all costs. He also in the daily conference
with the Chancellor on which he insisted,
used the common-sense argument that
the latter “must behave himself wisely, for
that the thing was remediless”—in other words,
that what was done could not be undone, a
highly characteristic attitude on the part of
the speaker.</p>

<p class='c012'>But if the King was prepared to be reconciled
to the match, no other member of the royal
family could be said to tolerate the idea, certainly
not the queen-mother, who was almost
beside herself with fury. Anne’s late mistress,
the Princess Royal, was also deeply incensed,
resenting the affront all the more from the
favour she had lavished for so many years on
her maid of honour. The storm so evoked raged
with more or less violence through the autumn.
The wrathful letters written by his mother, on
the first intelligence, James had shown to Anne,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and before he set out to meet his elder sister,
who was on her way to England, he came openly
to Worcester House, and taking the Chancellor
aside, said to him in a whisper that “he knew
that he had heard of the matter, that when
he came back he would give full satisfaction,
and that he was not to be offended with his
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What answer Hyde chose to make on this
occasion we do not know, nor how much he suspected,
but the “matter,” as the Duke called
it, had already been made absolutely sure.</p>

<p class='c012'>Worcester House had been the scene, not only
of romance, of love-trysts, of secret meetings
on summer nights, but it had witnessed a union
which was to have far-reaching results for the
realm of England.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the night of 3rd September 1660, James,
Duke of York, and Anne Hyde, did for the
second time plight their faith either to other.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The first of these may suffice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I, James Duke of York do testify and
declare that after I had for many months
sollicited Anne my wife in the way of marriage,
I was contracted to her on the 24th November
1659, at Breda in Brabant and after that tyme
and many months before I came into England
I lived with her (though with all possible
secrecy) as my Wife and after my coming into
this Kingdome, And that we might observe all
that is enjoyned by the Church of England I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>married her upon the third of September last
in the night between 11 and 12 at Worcester
House, my Chaplain, Dr Crowther performing
that office according as is directed by the Book
of Common Prayer the Lord Ossory being then
present and giving her in marriage of the truth
of all which I do take my corporall oath this
18 February 1660-61. <span class='sc'>James.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bride followed, and each of the witnesses
deposed in much the same terms, appending
their signatures with the exception of Ellen the
maid, who, as was usual in a person of her class
at that time, was unable to write, and therefore
“made her marke.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is very important here to notice that the
depositions were further endorsed thus:</p>

<p class='c012'>“James Duke of York and Anne Hyde
Duchess of York having been married at Breda.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Worcester House ceremony was therefore
to be regarded as simply a re-marriage to guard
against any possible doubts or difficulties that
might subsequently arise. It was by no means
unheard-of for a marriage to be repeated in
form where there existed any suspicion as to
complete regularity, but this did not render
the previous solemnisation less binding on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>parties. Considering the character of Anne,
who showed herself from first to last a proud,
resolute, as well as ambitious woman, the inference
is that she had looked on the Breda
ceremony as much more than a mere betrothal.
Putting aside the strong, even stern, religious
principles in which she, the pupil of Morley, had
been educated and which she had evinced from
childhood, one can arrive at but one conclusion
as far as she was concerned.</p>

<p class='c012'>But an event was to happen in the same
month of September, which for the time being
was to put aside the thought of everything else.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smallpox, the terrible scourge of the age, busy
at the dangerous season of the falling leaf, smote
the youngest son of the royal house, and on the
22nd, Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was dead
in the flush of his early youth.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had abundantly proved himself, in the
Spanish campaign, a gallant soldier at the side
of his brother James, and if there were already
signs manifested that he was not altogether untouched
by some of the failings of his race, that
question must be suffered to sleep with him.
In 1659, when he had been created by letters
patent Duke of Gloucester and Earl of Cambridge,
he had also been invested with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Garter at The Hague by Sir Edward Walker,
Garter King-at-Arms, but he was never installed.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In the anger and excitement consequent on
the discovery of the Duke of York’s stolen
marriage, the younger brother must needs put
in his word.</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not like Mistress Anne. He vowed
with boyish petulance that he hated “to be
in the room with her, she smelt so strong of
her father’s green bag.”<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a> And perhaps, who
knows? the impatient words may have rankled
in the mind of the latter, though it mattered
little after all.</p>

<p class='c012'>All too soon, alas! the grave closed over the
fair young head, and one forgets all that is best
forgotten. We only think tenderly of Henry
Stuart, as the loving child who sat on his doomed
father’s knee at that last piteous interview in
St James’s Palace, the day before the fatal 30th
January, and promised fealty to the brother who
was next to claim it, with the unquestioning
obedience of childhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles II., callous as he was steadily becoming

loss of his young brother,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a> and this unexpected
sorrow probably helped to soften him with regard
to events which were soon to follow. Over
in France, too, the little sister Henrietta, whose
short intercourse with her brother had been
marked by their mother’s unjust persecution
of him, wept passionately for him, as she had
been eagerly looking forward to seeing him again
during the visit she and her mother were on
the point of paying to England. At the boy’s
funeral in Westminster Abbey his brother James
was chief mourner.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, immediately following the arrival
of the Princess of Orange, a mysterious silence
fell on everything concerned with the marriage
of the Duke of York. To Anne, waiting in her
seclusion at Worcester House for both the
return of her husband and for the birth of their
child, now near at hand, the suspense must have
been little short of maddening. As we have
seen, the queen-mother’s bitter letter to her son
on the score of the marriage which she believed
to be not yet accomplished, had been shown to
his wife. The anger of the Princess Mary, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>deep as it was, could not account for the Duke’s
non-appearance. Had he not made assurance
doubly sure by the second ceremony? What
then was brewing?</p>

<p class='c012'>The clue to the mystery lay in the infamous
conspiracy now to be related.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Charles Berkeley, belonging at this time
to the Duke of York’s household, and certain
others, were destined to prove themselves with
a vengeance, the “naughty people” whom
Charles II. trenchantly denounced as having
too much weight with his brother.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no evidence that the queen-mother
had any knowledge whatever of the matter.
Passionate, prejudiced, and headstrong as
Henrietta Maria had often shown herself, it is
impossible to attach to her any of the guilt of
this abominable plot, although it is true that it
played into her hands; but she was far too outspoken
and impetuous to be concerned in it, or
to be taken into the confidence of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Berkeley above mentioned, who was
nephew to John, Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
James’ former tutor and bad adviser, had, it
appears, himself fallen in love with Mistress
Hyde, and his suit being rejected, made up his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>mind to gain her on any terms. It is to be
supposed that he was ignorant of the Worcester
House re-marriage, but at this moment he came
forward and with devilish effrontery declared
that the unhappy girl had been his mistress,
succeeding, moreover, in convincing Jermyn,
Arran, and Talbot of the truth of this
assertion.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

edit. Sir W. Scott, revised ed. 1846.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Besides his own ulterior views, Berkeley was
influenced by an inveterate spite against the
Chancellor, and being entirely unscrupulous he
took this dastardly means of gratifying his
enmity.</p>

<p class='c012'>The curious point about this transaction is
the ease with which the Duke of York fell into
the trap; but we are here confronted with the
most salient point of his character, which has
been noticed previously. He possessed what
might be called an obstinate fidelity to his
friends, or those whom he chose to consider as
such, and a singular obtuseness as to the nature
of their motives. Long before, as we have seen,
he had quarrelled with his elder brother because
Charles had discovered the treason of the elder
Berkeley in “trafficking” with Cromwell, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>had refused to dismiss him from his service:
now he clung stubbornly to the nephew, believing,
in spite of his own deep anguish, the
horrible slanders which the latter had coined
with regard to his wife. It was just this trait in
the character of James II. which was to prove
his undoing at the close of his stormy reign.
He trusted traitor after traitor, almost against
the evidence of his senses, till the end came, and
crown and kingdom had passed from him for
ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>On this occasion there is ample evidence of
James’ misery and despair. He was, besides,
in deep grief for the death of his brother the
Duke of Gloucester, who had been so closely
associated with him through the Spanish campaign,
and whom he loved with a protecting and
indulgent affection: and indeed at this time
he had himself fallen ill, having refused food in
his grief.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now, just a month after Gloucester’s untimely
death, in the midst of this web of deceit,
of false witness, of distress and unbearable
anxiety, an event occurred to which the persons
most nearly concerned looked with mingled
sentiments, but which was likely to prove of
profound consequence to the kingdom. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>22nd October, Anne, Duchess of York, gave birth
to her first-born son.</p>

<p class='c012'>As matters then were, this child, it must be
remembered, stood in the line of succession, the
King not being yet married; and he, at any rate,
fully recognised the importance of the occasion,
for he despatched Lady Ormonde and Lady
Sunderland (Waller’s “Sacharissa” of other
days) to Worcester House to be present at
the birth of the expected heir.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Dean Morley,
Anne’s spiritual adviser since her childhood, was
also summoned, and in view of the aspersions
against her now current, the poor mother was
solemnly exhorted in that extreme hour to
make profession on oath of her innocence in
respect of Berkeley’s hideous accusations, which
she did with a vehement earnestness and passion
in a degree which seems to have carried conviction
to those present.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It also appears that the King at this time laid
the facts of the contract at Breda before “some
Bishops and Judges,” and that they pronounced
that “according to the doctrine of the Gospel
and the law of England it was a good marriage.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
The second ceremony, that at Worcester House,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>which was thus rendered unnecessary, was kept
for some time a secret, but John Evelyn was one
of the first persons to have any accurate information
on the subject. As early as the 7th
October we find him entertaining at a farewell
dinner a French count with Sir George Tuke,
“being sent over by the Queen Mother to break
the marriage of the Duke with the daughter of
Chancellor Hyde. The Queen would fain have
undone it, but it seems matters were reconciled
on great offers of the Chancellor to befriend the
Queen, who was much in debt, and was now to
have the settlement of her affairs to go through
his hands.”<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Evelyn is too weighty and dispassionate as a
chronicler for his evidence to be set aside, but
this account reads a little strangely in the face
of Hyde’s anger and dismay, which no one supposed
other than sincere, when he was first made
aware of the matter, even begging the King’s
permission to give up office and go far from the
Court. On this point Burnet further declares
that all Clarendon’s enemies rejoiced at the
marriage, “for they reckoned it would raise
envy so high against him, and make the King
jealous,” and so “end in his ruin.” One must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>arrive at the conclusion that finding how far
things had gone, the Chancellor had for his own
sake, his daughter’s, and indeed for that of the
country, set himself to deprecate the wrath of
Henrietta in the readiest manner possible to him.
Most of her dower-lands had been parted among
the regicides, and he was probably able to
adjust some sort of restitution.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pepys, inquisitive as he was, like all inveterate
gossips, was entirely ignorant of the real facts
of the case till much later. On 24th October
he speaks of the Duke’s “amour,” though he
knows of the birth of the child. Even as late as
16th December he writes: “To my Lady’s [Lady
Sandwich] and staid with her an hour or two,
talking of the Duke of York and his lady, the
Chancellor’s daughter, between whom, she tells
me, all is agreed, and he will marry her.” This,
it must be remembered, is more than three
months after the Worcester House ceremony.</p>

<p class='c012'>But before this the principal enemy to the
marriage had arrived in England.</p>

<p class='c012'>On 2nd November King Charles came up by
water from Gravesend,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a> escorting, with all due
respect, “Mary the Queen Mother.” Henrietta,
it must be remembered, was always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>known in England in her own time as Queen
Mary.</p>

<p>HENRIETTA MARIA, “MOTHER QUEEN”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In the grey November weather the banks of
the Thames were not at their best, neither were
the feelings of the exiled Queen, who was
coming home at last. She too was changed.
The short-lived beauty of expression and grace
and vivacity had long fled, and it was a “little
plain old woman” who sat on the deck of the
royal barge, and gazed at scenes once familiar
through a mist of tears. So she came back, an
honoured guest indeed, but with all the wine of
life drained to the lees, to a country which had
dealt her the heaviest blows a woman could
endure, in the past. She was coming, too, with
a heart full of bitter wrath against the upstart
who had forced herself, so she considered, into
the circle of royalty. The Queen’s extreme
anger, it may be noted, was, in her case, in some
degree inconsistent, seeing that at one time
she had contemplated a match between her elder
son, the King of England (at that time if not
<i>de facto</i> at least <i>de jure</i>), and one of Mazarin’s
nieces, that bevy of lovely Mancini sisters, whose
beauty was so famous in their day, for they, we
are told, “sprang from the dregs of the people.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Otherwise no one can wonder at the indignation
of the haughty Bourbon princess, the daughter,
on one side at any rate, of a line of kings (and
even of the proud Hapsburg blood, through the
once despised Medici ancestry); and she came
now, as she said, “to prevent with her authority
so great a stain and dishonour to the Crown,”
by hindering her son James at all costs from
publicly recognising his marriage.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a> Indeed her
anger knew no bounds, and all her old prejudices
against Anne’s father had awakened once more,
adding fuel to the fire. At the moment, too, the
Duke of York played into his mother’s hands,
for he was then, as it were, reeling from the
frightful blow of Berkeley’s base accusations,
and only ready in his despair to repudiate alike
his wife and child.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>There was also, it appears, a general opinion
that the whole business spelt disaster to the
Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c012'>On 6th November, just after the Queen’s
arrival therefore, Pepys notes that “Mr Chetwind
told me that he did fear that the late
business of the Duke of York’s would prove fatal
to my Lord Chancellor,”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a> and the latter in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>own History avers that he “looked upon himself
as a ruined person,” and says bitterly that previous
to this the Duke’s manner to him “had
never anything of grace in it.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Meanwhile
Mary, Princess of Orange, had also come to
England, and was adding her voice to the chorus
of indignant reprobation. She could not for a
moment think, so she said, “of yielding precedence
to one whom she had honoured over much
by admitting her into her service as maid of
honour.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>So matters stood when suddenly a complete
reversal, in one direction, occurred.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whether Berkeley was touched by his master’s
misery, which to say the least of it seems unlikely,
or, which is more probable, he foresaw
that his own ends were unlikely to be served as
he expected by the slander he had coined, he
made at this time a full confession, and a powerful
auxiliary also came forward in the person of
the King, always henceforth a kind and steady
friend to his sister-in-law.</p>

<p class='c012'>On escaping from the sea of intrigue which
had almost fatally engulfed her, Anne did at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>least display great generosity and a lofty
capacity for forgiving injuries, for she pardoned
Berkeley the vile slanders with which he had
loaded her name, and even suffered him to kiss
her hand in token of amnesty, when with brazen
effrontery he presented himself before her.
Perhaps the revulsion was too great at the time
to admit of anything but relief; perhaps she
thought she could afford to be magnanimous,
seeing that her enemy had found himself unable
to drag her from her pride of place.</p>

<p class='c012'>James, on his part, at once and joyfully
acknowledged the marriage in defiance of his
family, and sent an affectionate message to his
wife, “bidding her to keep up her spirits for
Providence had cleared her aspersed fame, and
above all to have a care of his boy and that he
should come and see them both very shortly.”
It is evident that he had only been waiting for
the chance, for Lady Ormonde, who with her
husband was always a stanch friend to the
Hydes, and had been steadily convinced of
Anne’s innocence, said of the Duke that she
“perceived in him a kind of tenderness that
persuaded her he did not believe anything
amiss.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had now to withstand anew his mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>resentment, for when they first met, after his
reconciliation with Anne, the Queen refused to
speak to her son. She, however, adroitly turned
the circumstances of the King’s acknowledgment
of the match into a means of gaining his
consent to his younger sister’s marriage, for she
represented to him that he must consent to the
Princess Henrietta becoming Duchess of Orleans,
for “she could not suffer her to live at his Court
to be insulted by Hyde’s daughter.” The fact
of the case was that in England the Duchess of
York would take precedence of the Princess.
Whether this consideration weighed with
Charles or not, he made then no opposition to
the marriage of his favourite and “dearest
sister” with the cousin for whom he entertained,
with good reason, the strongest dislike and
contempt.</p>

<p class='c012'>On 26th November Lord Craven was writing
to the Queen of Bohemia of Anne: “She is
owned in her family to be Duchess of York, but
not at Whitehall as yet, but it is very sure that
the Duke has made her his wife. Your Majesty
knows it is what I have feared long although
you were not of that opinion. The Princess
[Mary] is much discontented at it, as she has
reason.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>He wrote again on the 28th: “I cannot tell
what will become of your godson’s business:
the child is not yet christened, but it is confidently
reported that it shall be within a few
days, and owned. The Princess is very much
troubled about it; the queen is politic and says
little of it. There is no question to be made
but that they are married. They say my lord
Chancellor shall be made a duke.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of York was godson of his aunt
Elizabeth, it must be noted here.</p>

<p class='c012'>So things were, but before the year had ended
death was to lay once more effacing fingers on
discord and bitterness.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Princess Royal, who had come, as we
have seen, to rejoice with one brother on his
long delayed Restoration, to resent hotly the
other’s unwelcome marriage, was seized like
Henry of Gloucester with smallpox on the
18th December.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has been hinted that she was a party to
Berkeley’s plot, though, in view of her character,
this is very unlikely; and it is also said that on
her uneasy deathbed in the grip of that ghastly
and relentless pestilence, she declared herself

<p class='c012'>Be that as it may, Mary Stuart passed away
at Somerset House on Christmas Eve 1660, just
three months after her youngest brother.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>On the 29th December her body was brought
by torchlight to Westminster Abbey, and laid
in the Stuart vault by that of Gloucester, her
brother James again officiating as chief mourner.
On this occasion one can only contemplate with
amazement what appears the entire callousness
of the queen-mother. Whether her anger at
the marriage of the Duke of York occupied her
mind to the exclusion of all natural affection, it
is hard to say, but there is no record of any great
grief on her part for poor young Gloucester’s
untimely end, and she certainly showed extraordinary
indifference with regard to her elder
daughter, according to most chroniclers; though
one account certainly does credit her with the
wish to remain with her till forbidden by the
doctors. In terror for her youngest, the mother
fled from Somerset House when the sickness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>declared itself, and betook herself with the
Princess Henrietta to St James’s, leaving Mary
to her fate. But it is to be remarked, that from
the time her youngest child was restored to her
by Lady Dalkeith after their escape, the Queen
concentrated all the force of her affection on her.
Possibly the fact of her being allowed to bring
her up in her own religion undisturbed may
have had something to do with it, but the fact
remains that for the last few years of her life she
showed comparatively little affection for her
other children.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of Mary’s oldest attendants was destined
to make her home in England. The minister
Van der Kirckhove Heenvliet died in March of
this year, and his widow, Lady Stanhope, to
whom Charles II. allowed the title of Lady
Chesterfield, to which her first husband would
have succeeded, married as her third husband
the adventurous Daniel O’Neill of whom mention
has already been made.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

O’Neill had been imprisoned in the Tower in 1643, but
escaped and reached Holland in safety.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on the death of the Princess
Royal, the queen-mother suddenly announced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to her son James that she withdrew her opposition
to his marriage. It is just possible that the
loss of her daughter may have exercised a softening
influence, but it is more probable that this
change of front was owing to a warning from
Mazarin, who sent her a peremptory message
to keep on good terms alike with her sons and
the English Ministers of State, and the impoverished
Queen could not afford to disregard
the powerful adviser of Anne of Austria.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Whatever
the motive, the result was plain. Three
days after the funeral of Mary, her mother so
far did violence to her own strong and bitter
prejudice as to consent to receive not only her
son, but the hated daughter-in-law. On 1st
January Pepys records the fact: “Mr Moore
and I went to Mr Pierce’s, in our way seeing
the Duke of York bring his lady to wait upon
the Queen, the first time that ever she did since
that business, and the Queen is said to receive
her with much respect and love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hyde was informed of this communication by that industrious

at this time.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>This latter statement may be taken with a
grain of salt, but Henrietta did control her
feelings sufficiently to behave with dignity and
self-restraint. As she passed to dinner, her
ladies following her, through the corridor of
St James’s Palace, Anne was waiting, white and
trembling, with a thickly beating heart, and she
fell on her knees as “Mary the Queen Mother”
swept by in her mourning robes. With the
stately gesture the latter could assume at will,
she turned, and raising the girl, she kissed her,
and leading her to the table placed her at her
side.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>On the same day, the Queen made a still
further concession. She consented to see Hyde
himself, receiving him graciously and speaking
at length of the matter in hand. “He could
not,” she said, “wonder, much less take it ill,
that she had been offended with the Duke, and
had no inclination to give her consent to his
marriage, and if she had in the Passion that
could not be condemned in her, spoke anything
of him that he had taken ill, he ought to impute
it to the Provocation she had received though
not from him. She was now informed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>King, and well-assured that he had no hand in
contriving that Friendship, but was offended
with that Passion that really was worthy of
him. That she could not but confess that his
Fidelity to the King her husband was very
eminent and that he had served the King her
son with equal fidelity and extraordinary success.
And therefore she had received his daughter
as her Daughter and heartily forgave the Duke
and her and was resolved ever after to live with
all the affection of a Mother towards them.
So she resolved to make a Friendship with him,
and hereafter to expect all the offices from him
which her kindness should deserve.”<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Hyde, as might be expected, showed himself
equal to the occasion, though he must have
felt that the Queen did him no more than justice
when she thus acknowledged his services to her
husband and son.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She could not,” answered the courtier,
“show too much anger and aversion, and had
too much forgotten her own honour and dignity
if she had been less offended.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But nevertheless the wounds which Henrietta’s
unbridled tongue had inflicted in time past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>were not so easily healed. Clarendon himself
remarks bitterly: “From that time there did
never appear any want of kindness in the Queen
towards him, whilst he stood in no need of it,
nor until it might have done him some
good.”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Yet a truce was signed as it were, and peace
was in a fair way to be established. But still
the Chancellor was never entirely reconciled to
his daughter’s lofty alliance, on which he looked
with doubt and misgiving to the end.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some ten days before this momentous interview
Evelyn speaks of the marriage as fully
acknowledged. Under the date of 22nd December
he writes:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The marriage of the Chancellor’s daughter
being now newly owned, I went to see her, she
being Sir Richard Browne’s intimate acquaintance,
when she waited on the Princess of Orange.
She was now at her father’s at Worcester House
in the Strand. We all kissed her hand as did
also my Lord Chamberlain Manchester, and the
Countess of Northumberland. This was a
strange change. Can it succeed well?”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Strange indeed, and no one can wonder that
a mind so thoughtful, uplifted, and restrained as
that of John Evelyn, who had known the father
through good and evil days, who remembered
from her childhood the girl, now a princess of
England, should doubt the final issue of such a
turn of fortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two days after Anne’s reception at Court her
child was baptized at Worcester House by the
name of Charles, the King and Monk, now Duke
of Albemarle, being godfathers, while the queen-mother
sealed her reconciliation by undertaking
the office of godmother, the other being Lady
Ormonde, and the boy was created Duke of
Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c012'>During this same month of January, Henrietta
closed her first visit to England after the
Restoration. It had not been a happy one. It
had been clouded with heavy grief and bereavement,
besides reviving poignant recollections,
and she had moreover sustained the vexation
and disappointment which her second son’s
marriage had inflicted on her, from which she
had by no means recovered, in spite of her
altered attitude towards the offenders.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>JOHN EVELYN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>She was impatient to escape, and eager besides
for the marriage of her sole remaining daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the disastrous results of which it was impossible
for her to foresee. She was also anxious, on
account of her health, to visit the baths of
Bourbon which then enjoyed a great reputation.</p>

<p class='c012'>The King accompanied his mother and sister
to Portsmouth, where they embarked, but the
Duke of York remained in London. He was
still ill and depressed. He had passed through
a period of acute pain and anxiety; he had
really felt deeply the death of the sister who had
always been to him, at least, staunchly affectionate,
at a time when he needed affection, and now
he “being indisposed was at Whitehall with
the Dutchess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the time of the Restoration Hyde had refused
a peerage, but now, for obvious reasons,
he signified his acceptance of one, and on the
6th November he had taken his seat as Baron
Hyde of Hindon in Wilts (near Hatch, where
Laurence Hyde, his ancestor, had lived). Moreover
the King made him a grant of twenty
thousand pounds out of the amount (fifty thousand
pounds) which Parliament had sent the
latter at The Hague, at which time the Duke of
York, by the way, had received ten thousand
pounds and Gloucester five thousand pounds.
Later, that is in April 1661, Hyde received his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>final honours, being created Earl of Clarendon
and Viscount Cornbury.</p>

<p class='c012'>A closing epilogue to the drama of the
marriage comes from the pen of Lord Craven.
Writing to the Queen of Bohemia on 11th
January 1661 he says: “I have this morning
been to wait upon the duchess; she lies here and
the King very kind to her: she takes upon her
as if she been duchess this seven years. She
is very civil to me.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a> And on 23rd February:
“The greatest news we have here is that upon
Monday last, the duke and duchess were called
before the Council and were to declare when
and where they were married and their answer
was that they were married the 3rd of September
last, in a chamber at Worcester House, Mr
Crowther married them; nobody but my Lord
of Ossory and her maid Nell by; but that they
had been contracted long. That is all that I
can hear of the business.”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>It</span> is hard to survey quite dispassionately, or
even thoroughly to understand, the attitude of
Anne Hyde on safely attaining her new dignity,
the dizzy height to which she had climbed by
such a thorny path. She seems, unhappily, to
have had enemies from the first, but whether
they were due to her father’s steadily increasing
unpopularity, to her own behaviour, or to envy
of her success, easily comprehensible, it is difficult
to determine. Probably each of these
conditions had something to do with it.</p>
<p class='c012'>As regards her conduct, James himself says
of her: “Her want of birth was made up by
endowments, and her carriage afterwards became
her acquired dignity.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Pepys, who, as
has been already remarked, never lost an opportunity
of a fleer at her, says, as early as 13th
April 1661, of “Edward Pickering his discourse
most about the pride of the Duchess of York.”
This may or may not be true, for Pepys was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>nothing if not prejudiced, and the man who
could, with his eyes open, write with foolish
admiration of “my dear Lady Castlemaine,”
cannot be considered an authority to be altogether
respected. It is however certain, from
other sources, that from the first, Duchess Anne
was known unfavourably for her arrogance.
Even Lord Craven, as we have seen, had noticed
it, and he had no reason to be specially biassed.
On this point also the French ambassador, the
Comte de Cominges, remarks with some covert
amusement: “She upholds with as much
courage, cleverness and energy the dignity to
which she has been called, as if she were of the
blood of the kings or of Gusman at the least, or
Mendoza.”<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Bishop Burnet, who evidently held her in
great respect, and usually extols her, says:
“She soon understood what belonged to a
Princess, and took state upon her rather too
much.”<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>We have to piece together these stray scraps
of evidence in the best manner possible, and in
so doing come to the conclusion that Anne, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>finding herself publicly acknowledged Duchess
of York, and wife of the heir presumptive to the
Crown, also found that she had set her foot on
the first steps of a difficult and stony road, and
that possibly she conceived her only chance in
such a position was to assume and maintain a
defensive attitude. A perpetual uneasy consciousness
of her hardly acquired rank made
her afraid of stepping for one moment off the
pedestal to which she had been raised, and this
of itself would serve to make her unpopular.
It must be remembered also that the society
which surrounded her, reckless, wild, unscrupulous
as it was, was yet one which guarded
jealously the traditions of high rank and lofty
descent, and in the fervour of the Restoration was
inclined to resent hotly the intrusion of a parvenue
into the narrow circle of the blood royal
of England and was only too ready to find fault
whenever a loophole could be given. Poor
Anne, it is to be feared, afforded many such.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps it may be as well to discuss in this
place the vexed question of her personal appearance.
On 20th April of this year 1661, Pepys
writes acidly: “Saw the King and Duke of
York and his Duchess, which is a plain woman,
and like her mother my Lady Chancellor.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>In fact, if nearly all the pictures of her which
exist may be trusted, they certainly dispose of
Anne’s pretensions to beauty. They represent
for the most part a large, heavy looking woman,
with an abnormally wide mouth; and we know
from contemporary evidence that she became
very fat early in life.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is true that Sir John Reresby, who is never
ill natured, generously calls her “a very handsome
woman,”<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a> but only one other chronicler,
Granger, in his Biographical History, ventures
on such an opinion. Bronconi, in his
Journal, declares without circumlocution: “La
Duchesse de York est fort laide, la bouche
extraordinairement fendue, et les yeux fort
craillez, mais très courtoise.” The famous
Grammont, a professed critic of beauty, alluding
to the marriage, says: “The bride was no
perfect beauty,” and elsewhere sums up the
case judicially:</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>“She had a majestic mien, a pretty good
shape, not much beauty, a great deal of wit
[this Reresby and others endorse] and so just
a discernment of merit that whoever of either
sex were possessed of it were sure to be distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>by her, an air of grandeur in all her
actions made her to be considered as if born to
support the rank which placed her so near the
throne.”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

Grammont, ed. by Sir Walter Scott, revised ed. 1846.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Considering the passion which Anne had certainly
inspired in several men, and which in the
Duke of York had now raised her to her lofty
position, one is forced to the conclusion that, in
spite of her lack of physical beauty, she must
have been possessed of some conquering charm
of manner which, joined to undoubted wit
and certain brilliant endowments of mind, made
up for the want of personal attractions in an
age which, perhaps of all others, most prized
such an attribute.</p>

<p class='c012'>This too would partly account for the steady
friendship which her brother-in-law the King
always testified for her. He was, it is true, a
connoisseur of beauty of all types, but he also
greatly valued wit, and keenly appreciated any
one who could and would amuse him. He had
the strong sense of humour which is often allied
to a saturnine disposition, and which we know
never failed him to the end. His own wife, with
all her good qualities, which were quite definite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>with her adoring and pathetic devotion to himself,
was nevertheless, we fear, not amusing,
and he probably found in his plebeian sister-in-law
a quickness of apprehension which appealed
to his strain of cynicism and impatience of dullness;
and which was not always allied to the
radiant and undoubted beauty which he admired
in other women.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

feeling towards his sister-in-law in a present made to her.
The letter is to Sir Stephen Fox:</p>

<p class='c038'>“<span class='sc'>Charles R.</span></p>
<p class='c029'>“Our will and pleasure is yt you forthwith pay to Sir John
Shaw ye sum of one thousand pounds in ys of a necklace of

doing this shal be yor warrt. Given at or Court at Whitehall
this 19th of July 1661” (Egerton MS.).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Duchess Anne had for her part “wit and
agreeable manners, but without personal
charm,” and Jesse rather ponderously asserts:
“In the character of Anne Hyde there seems
to have been more to admire than to love.
She was possessed rather of dignity than grace,
rather of masculine sense than feminine gentleness.”<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
And Burnet further testifies that she
was “a woman of great spirit,” “a very extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>woman,” who “had great knowledge
and a lively sense of things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus equipped by nature, by education, by
experience, Nan Hyde, the maid of honour in
past years of the Mary who now slept hard by
among her kindred in the Abbey, began her
career as a princess, fully aware, there can be
no doubt, of the many pitfalls which menaced
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>The arena into which she stepped was a
brilliant one. The Court of England, after the
long stormy interval during which such a thing
did not exist, became “very magnificent,” and
the fact is readily comprehensible.</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles II. had so long lived an out-at-elbows
life, from hand to mouth, as it were, that the
inheritance to which he had at last succeeded
and the fifty thousand “gold pieces” voted by
Parliament must have seemed for the time being
inexhaustible, and a character like his would
set no bounds to his careless extravagance.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a>
His ideas were naturally lavish and picturesque,
and there were always plenty of people about
him quite willing—and more than willing—to
minister to these; many hands in his pockets,
moreover, as well as his own.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>This state of things was, too, for a time at
any rate, not unacceptable to the people at
large. Through the grim years of the Civil
War, and during the severe rule of the Commonwealth,
they had been condemned to a lack of
beauty in life, to sad-coloured raiment, to stern
repression, to an absence of all the amusement
and colour which had pervaded England in the
joyous, if strenuous, Elizabethan age and the
first years of the succeeding century.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that
the commonalty, wearied and fretted by their
Puritan taskmasters, should be dazzled by the
vision of a gracious young king, easy of access,
genial of speech, surrounded moreover by
splendour, beauty and gaiety.</p>

<p class='c012'>We know now what underlay the vision. We
know what was destined to become a headlong
race of folly—and worse, but it was all at first,
at least, very seductive.</p>

<p class='c012'>And in the midst of it all now moved the new
Duchess of York, for a few months, at least, the
first lady in the kingdom, until the King should
find himself a bride.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have seen that Anne’s father participated
in some of the state which surrounded her;
the dignities conferred on him, fully as his long-tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>service had merited them, being as much
for his daughter’s honour as for his own.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pepys gives us a glimpse, now and then, of
the doings at Court during the spring of 1661.
Early in April he is in St James’s Park to watch
the Duke of York play at “Pele-mele, the first
time that ever I saw the sport.”<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a> James, like
all his family, was very active in body, loving
sport and games of every kind. He was
passionately devoted to hunting, and this continued
to the end. Long afterwards, along the
grassy rides of the forests of Saint Germain or
Marly, the banished King of England would
sweep down with his train, forgetting for a few
exhilarating moments the pain of loss and exile
and the green glades of Windsor which he would
never see again. It may be remembered, moreover,
that when Prince George of Denmark
testified some alarm at his own tendency to
fat, Charles II. gave him promptly the advice:
“Walk with me, and hunt with my brother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke was also very fond of tennis, but
here he was excelled by his cousin Prince Rupert,
the best player in England. The Prince
Palatine had not accompanied the King at the
time of the Restoration, but had arrived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>England in September of the same year, after
the death of the Duke of Gloucester, when he
came armed with a commission to ask for the
hand of the Princess Henrietta on behalf of
the Emperor Leopold. We have seen that this
overture was useless, the queen-mother being
unwilling to consider anything which could clash
with the claims of her nephew the Duke of
Orleans.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The coronation of Charles II. took place on
St George’s Day, 23rd April, the culmination of
the Restoration rejoicings, but the month of
May was to see the withering of the first flower
of the royal stem.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The little Duke of Cambridge, round whose
cradle such a storm of passion had raged, died
on the 5th. Pepys spitefully volunteers the
opinion that the poor baby’s death, he believes,
“will please everybody, and I hear that the
Duke and his lady themselves are not much
troubled at it”<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a>; a conclusion which seems, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>every ground, very unlikely. James was to
prove himself a deeply affectionate father, and
Anne’s strength and tenacity of feeling were not
likely to fail in this direction, though it is quite
possible that she made little demonstration outwardly
of grief.</p>

<p class='c012'>During this year the King’s aunt Elizabeth,
the “Winter Queen,” was at last suffered to
revisit her native country after so many stormy
years. She had been passionately desirous to
do so, though England could have been little
more than a memory. But at one time she had
been enshrined in the hearts and imaginations
of the English, some of whom would have
willingly set aside her brother’s children and
accepted her son, Charles Louis, as king. No
doubt the knowledge of this lingered in the
Queen’s mind when she set sail once more for
her early home, but as happens to many in like
circumstances, it meant disillusion. The radiant
Queen of Hearts, whom Christian of Anhalt and
many another chivalrous warrior had adored,
was no more the same, and she came back, we
fear, to find herself forgotten.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Only Craven
was left, to whom she had been the one and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>only star, a few—very few—faithful friends,
and her gallant son Rupert. At first she stayed
at Drury House, the guest of Lord Craven, but
later she removed to a house of her own in
Leicester Field. Here, only a few months after,
she died, in February 1662.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>In the old days at The Hague and Breda, as
we have seen, Elizabeth had been good to
Chancellor Hyde’s young daughter, and had
strenuously backed the Princess Mary’s choice
of the girl as maid of honour, little dreaming
how nearly they were destined to be related.</p>

<p class='c012'>Did the Duchess of York remember the many
kindnesses shown to Nan Hyde, now when it
had become possible to repay them? One must
hope so, for there is no record to tell us.</p>

<p class='c012'>The day of the Queen of Bohemia’s funeral,
on 20th February, there was a terrible storm, a
type indeed of the unquiet life now closed.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>That spring of 1662 saw the expected change
in the position and prospects of the Duchess
of York, for the negotiations for the King’s
marriage were now completed. One of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>basest of the many slanders current against
Clarendon was that he pushed on the match with
Catherine of Bragança by every means in his
power, knowing that she would never bear
children, in order to ensure the succession to the
Crown to his daughter’s offspring.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a matter of fact, though the Queen was
destined never to become the mother of a living
child, it is yet certain that more than once she
had the hope of maternity.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, scandal of every sort and kind was
never more rife than in the reckless, pleasure-loving,
unscrupulous Court of Charles II.
Every one seems to have said whatever he or
she chose, without the slightest reference to
truth, if that was likely to spoil a piquant story,
and no one was more victimised in this respect
than the Lord Chancellor, who thus paid the
penalty of success. His friend Evelyn was
among the few who never wavered in their
loyal attachment, and who never said a bitter
or ill-natured thing. This friendship, by the
way, brought the diarist into closer relation
with the Duke of York, for in January we find
the latter announcing that he intended to visit
the garden at Sayes Court, already famous for
its rare and lovely plants, the care bestowed on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>it, and the culture of its gifted owner.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a> The
next month, too, Evelyn records that he is
present at a comedy acted before the Duchess
at the Cockpit.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>But the new queen was soon to be expected.
On the 23rd April, the anniversary of the
coronation, she set sail for England, arriving
at Portsmouth on 14th May.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of York, in virtue of his office of
Lord High Admiral, was despatched to receive
her as his brother’s representative, and she
welcomed him in her cabin, sitting under a
canopy on a chair of state, but displaying frank,
if shy cordiality.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Charles himself was in no
violent hurry to see his richly-dowered bride,
for he did not leave London till the 19th,
travelling in Lord Northumberland’s coach.
However, when he did arrive, no further time
was lost, for the pair were married by Sheldon
on the 22nd, in the great hall or presence-chamber
in the governor’s lodging (now swept
away) at Portsmouth. The register is in the
Parish Church of St Thomas. They finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>reached Hampton Court, where the honeymoon
was to be spent, on the 29th, the King professing
himself perfectly satisfied with his new wife.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>On the same evening the Duchess of York
arrived to pay her duty to the Queen. It must
have cost her an effort, for her second child,
Mary, destined in after days to be queen, had
been born barely a month previously, on the
30th of April—Prince Rupert, by the way, being
her godfather. The Duchess came by water,
in her own beautiful barge, and as she landed
at the steps the King was waiting at the garden
gate near by, and taking her by the hand, he led
her along the straight, smooth alleys into the
ancient palace, and so into the new Queen’s
bedroom. Anne would have knelt to kiss her
hand, but Catherine prevented the act of
homage, and raising her, kissed her affectionately.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The poor little lonely bride, fresh from her
convent and narrow upbringing, much younger
than her actual years, bewildered by the
racket in which she found herself, was perhaps
already hungering for some one of her own sex
to whom she could venture to unbend, and saw
an augury for future friendship and confidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>in the assured carriage, the fresh face, the steady,
resolute eyes of English Nan. If so, she was not
likely under present circumstances to be disappointed;
even the King was perfectly willing
to sanction such advances.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the 15th August Evelyn mentions a visit
paid to him by the Lord Chancellor. Hyde, as
we know, had a year before received the earldom
of Clarendon,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a> and though this occasion seemed
to have been simply a friendly one, yet his
purse and mace were borne before him when he
came to Sayes Court. The diarist further
notes: “They were likewise collationed with
us, and were very merry. They had all been
our old acquaintances in exile.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Before the year was out the queen-mother
came to pay her second visit, after the Restoration,
to England. This time it was to welcome
the new daughter-in-law who, besides her royal
blood and rank, had brought such a splendid
dower to the needy crown of England. The
first meeting took place at the ancient palace
of Greenwich, which had been little used for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>many years, its day having almost passed.
Here Henrietta made the gentle Portuguese
bride sit on one arm-chair on her right hand,
while she herself occupied another. The King,
waiving his precedence, of which, indeed,
he was never very tenacious in such matters,
took a stool, while the Duchess of York sat on
one also, and the Duke stood by them.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a> It
sounds very much as if they grouped themselves
with an eye to portraiture, but it was really a
matter of some importance, and thus Anne was,
we see, accorded what in France was called the
right of the “tabouret” by the dreaded queen,
who less than two years back had declared that
if the hated interloper were to enter the room
by one door, she herself would leave by another.
But time has its revenges, and on the return
visit, which was paid at Hampton Court, which
to the queen-mother must indeed have been full
of bitter-sweet memories, when she, naturally,
was placed on Catherine’s right hand, the
Duchess of York was even provided with a
chair a little to the left.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>As far as the young Queen was concerned, the
auspicious beginning with regard to Anne was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>justified. She always remained on friendly
terms with her sister-in-law. Her yielding,
placable nature deferred readily to one whose
qualities provided the complement of her own,
and later events knitted a closer bond of union
between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess of York
took up their quarters in St James’s Palace, the
traditional residence of the heir presumptive—the
ancient manor of Henry VIII.—of whose
building little remains now but the brick gate-way.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
It seems to have been furnished with
great splendour, and under Anne’s resolute sway
her Court was more stately and ceremonious
than that at Whitehall, where the motto might
have been that of Medmenham in later days:
“Fais ce que voudras.” In an idle age, moreover,
the Duchess was not idle. “She writ
well,” says Burnet, “and had begun the Duke’s
life, of which she showed me a volume. It was
all drawn from his journal, and he intended to
have employed me in carrying it on.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

work that Horace Walpole gave the writer a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>place in his catalogue of noble authors, although,
it is true, he never saw the work in question.
Anne also took a more or less intelligent interest
in the art of her time and country, for it was she
who projected the Series of Beauties to be
painted by Lely, whose genius was employed for
many years of this reign.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a> She could at least
appreciate beauty in others, if she had but little
herself, and for this scheme we certainly owe
her a debt of gratitude.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The Christmas after the King’s marriage was
marked by more than the usual festivities.
Secretary Pepys, always on the watch to see
and retail all that was to be seen, went eagerly
to watch the royal party dancing at Whitehall.
The Queen, it seems, did not dance, but the
King, who “danced rarely,” took out the
Duchess of York, and the Duke the Duchess
of Buckingham, to dance the bransle, where
hands were taken in turn. After this the King
led a lady through a lively coranto, in which
dance it appears he excelled; and another of
the best performers was the little Duchess of
Monmouth, Anne Scott, the greatest heiress of
her day, who in her childhood had been given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to the unlucky pretender who was to suffer so
grim a fate in after days.</p>

<p class='c012'>But happy and triumphant as one may picture
her, the personal troubles of the Duchess
had already begun. In the autumn just past
there occurred the Duke’s ephemeral passion
for Elizabeth Butler, Lady Chesterfield, the
daughter of Ormonde, who on her part by no
means reciprocated it, but to put an end to the
situation, which she probably found embarrassing,
promptly retired into the country from
London.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“January 19, 1663.—This day by Dr Clarke I was told
the occasion of my Lord Chesterfield’s going and taking his
lady (my Lord Ormond’s daughter) from Court. It seems
he not only hath been long jealous of the Duke of York, but
did find them two talking together, though there were others
in the room, and the lady by all opinions a most good,
virtuous woman. He the next day (of which the Duke
was warned by somebody that saw the passion my Lord
Chesterfield was in the night before) went and told the
Duke how much he did apprehend himself wronged in his
picking out his lady of the whole Court to be the subject of
his dishonour, which the Duke did answer with great calmness
not seeming to understand the reason of complaint;
and that was all that passed, but my Lord did presently
pack his lady into the country in Derbyshire near the Peake”

<p class='c012'>Poor Duchess Anne, however, took it passionately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>to heart, and complained vehemently not
only to the King, who was scarcely likely to give
her much sympathy—though he did remove
Lord Chesterfield from his office of Groom of the
Stole to the Queen—but to Ormonde himself,
who, it must be remembered, was her father’s
old friend. It is also probable that she and
Lady Chesterfield must have had some degree
of intimacy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pepys, of all people, took it on himself to
moralise on the subject. “At all which I am
sorry,” he writes, “but it is the effect of idleness
and having nothing else to employ their great
spirits upon,” which seems an insufficient
reason. Lady Chesterfield, who never returned
to London, died two years later at Bretby,
leaving a daughter who eventually married Lord
Strathmore.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>By the month of January 1663 the Duke and

see <i>Claracilla</i> done by the King’s players, and
there scandalised the ubiquitous Secretary by
“dalliance there before the whole world, such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>kissing and leaning upon one another,” a very

Portsmouth, and the Duke’s guards are to meet him on the
way.” 17th September, Portsmouth.—Thomas Lancaster
and Hugh Salisbury to the same (Navy Commissioners):
“Arrived of the Foresight at Spithead, the Duke and
Duchess of York being in Portsmouth on their way to Winchester,
boats have been sent by Mr Coventry’s order to
bring the Duke down to see the Dock,” etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the 22nd September the King and his train
left Bath and proceeded first to Badminton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>where they dined, their host being Lord Herbert.
They went thence to Cirencester, where they
were received by Lord Newburgh, and remained
for that night. The next day they went on to
Oxford, and were met on the border of the
county by Lord Cornbury (Duchess Anne’s
elder brother) with the high sheriff and two
troops of horse militia, besides volunteers.
Further on they were met by Clarendon himself
as Lord-Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, and he entertained
them with great splendour and hospitality
at his house of Cornbury. Then on the 28th
the expedition passed on to Oxford itself, near
to which they were received by the heads of
houses, the vice-chancellor in a short speech
giving the usual presents to the King and Queen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Oxford, who had seen within her grey walls
the dwindling Court of the martyred king, who
had vindicated her loyalty so stoutly, who had
suffered with such constancy, received now the
recognition of her fealty. None could express
gratitude with more consummate grace than
Charles II., nor clothe appropriate sentiments
with more fitting words, and if the hearers were
forced to the conviction that they were words
and nothing more, still they left their own
impress behind them.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>The King and Queen, the Duke and Duchess
of York, and most of the train were on horseback,
and the cavalcade as it swept up the
High Street, past University, and Queen’s and
St Mary’s Church made a very goodly show by
means of colour and movement, waving plumes
and fluttering ribbons, glitter of jewels and sheen
of satin and velvet. Just so had the Cavaliers
who had rallied to the royal standard twenty
years back adorned the same streets with life
and colour. For them, too, the bells had pealed
out and the citizens stood to watch, and they
were gone—and some of them forgotten.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

Recorder made a speech, and the Mayor gave a present. The
City militia guarded them to the North gate, the gownsmen
to Christ Church, and the scholars of Christ Church made
them a guard in the great quadrangle to their lodgings,
where Dr Fell the Dean and the Canons received them with
a short speech. On the 24th the University went in procession
to Christ Church to know when they would visit the
University, and the 28th was fixed upon. On the 25th the
King and Duke went to Cornbury to see Woodstock Park
and the places near, returning to Oxford to dinner. On
the Sunday they all attended service at Christ Church, when
Dean Fell preached a seasonable and excellent sermon”
(“Calendar of Domestic State Papers”).</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In 1665 there seems to have been another combined
excursion westward.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ambassador Van Gogh, writing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>States General from Chelsea, on 24th July
records:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The King and Duke of York go on Thursday
from Hampton Court for three or four days
and then to Salisbury, whither the Queen and
Duchess are already gone.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Somewhere about this time an idea seems to
have got about that the Duke of York was
completely ruled by his wife, submissive to her
will in all things.</p>

<p class='c012'>An opinion to this effect was openly expressed
by the King, whose tongue was never too
scrupulous, and who nicknamed his brother
“Tom Otter” after the henpecked husband in
Ben Jonson’s “Epicene, or Silent Woman,” and
elsewhere we are told that James “seemed in
awe of his wife.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a> If so, this state of things did
not long continue, and in any case it is altogether
foreign to the character of the Duke of
York, as we know it. He was at no time a
person to be easily overawed, whether by his
wife or another. That she influenced him up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to a certain point is very probable, but there
were distinct limits to that. Even the amount
of influence which Anne exercised in the early
days of their marriage was destined to decrease
before long, and that for a reason which must
now be given. The grounds for this reason
cannot be satisfactorily examined nor the
evidence sifted, for that is no longer possible.
There are, as almost always occurs, conflicting
and contrary accounts; that is in the nature of
things.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is no happy nor welcome task to trace the
progress of disillusionment, estrangement, coldness,
following the ill-assorted union of the
King’s brother and the Chancellor’s daughter.
One can so easily picture the eager bystanders
murmuring with unctuous satisfaction the time-honoured
conclusion: “I told you so!” And
yet—“The pity of it, Iago, the pity of it!”
One would gladly omit from the record of that
marriage the chapter which must now perforce
be set down, if only for the sake of all that went
before, of all that was to follow.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the year 1640, when the Earl of Leicester—who
was afterwards to be half guardian, half
jailer, of Princess Elizabeth and her youngest
brother at Penshurst—was ambassador at Paris,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the youngest of his famous sons, Henry, was
born there. When he was eighteen his mother,
whose favourite he is said to have been, died,
and in 1665 he was attached to the household
of the Duke of York as Groom of the Bedchamber.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f177'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r177'>177</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of
the Stuarts,” John Heneage Jesse. “She is said to have
proposed the Duke’s journey to York in 1665 to be more
with Sidney.”</p>
<p class='c012'>“Diary of the Times of Charles II.,” by Henry Sidney,
Earl of Romney. Edit. R. W. Blencowe (Introduction).</p>

<p class='c012'>“History of My Own Time,” Burnet. “A very graceful
young man of quality that belonged to her Court.”
“The Duke took up a jealousy, put the person out of his
Court.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>He had his full share of the hereditary beauty
of his family, the beauty which distinguished his
sister Dorothy, married three years after his
birth to the gallant young Sunderland who fell
at Newbury, and his brother Robert, believed
by many of his contemporaries to be the father
of Monmouth, and who was known in his day
as the “handsome Sidney.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Conscious or not of his personal advantages,
Henry Sidney fell passionately in love with
the Duchess, but that wild adoration was no
secret. Such things never were at that time,
and the Court speedily rang with the tale.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Pepys licks his eager lips over the matter.
“Pimm tells me,” he writes, “how great a difference
hath been between the Duke and Duchess,
he suspecting her to be naught with Mr Sidney.
But some way or other the matter is made up,
but he was banished the Court, and the Duke
for many days did not speak to the Duchess
at all.” Anthony Hamilton pronounced her
guilty, but Reresby, always kind and never
scandalous, says stoutly the Duchess “was kind
to him and no more.” One thing is certain,
James was hotly jealous of his servant. If there
really was any truth in the aspersion on her,
if Anne, in her lonely splendour, conscious of
her husband’s waning affection, resenting his
infidelity, turned to the love laid humbly and
adoringly at her feet, then we can but say:
God pity her! for she was destined to drink
deep of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it is quite as easy and fully as reasonable
to give her the benefit of the doubt. From what
we have already seen, from what we have still
to see, it can be argued that she was too resolute,
too self-contained, too guarded, to succumb at
this period of her life to mere personal attraction.
She had risked too much, had won her
honours too hardly, to venture them easily.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>That she was accused goes for nothing. Almost
every one was accused sooner or later, and the
particular accusation may very well have been
an ill-natured tale invented to blacken an unpopular
princess. The hero of the romance,
Henry Sidney, “the handsomest youth of his
time,” was destined to a brilliant career in after
days.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a> The short-lived disgrace which was the
immediate consequence of his passion for the
Duchess, did him no harm. Much later, it is
true, he was dismissed from office, but he was
made envoy to the States of Holland, and remained
there two years, having declined the
embassy in Paris. It is said that he voted
for the exclusion of the Duke of York from
the succession, in the Parliament which met in
1680, when member for Bramber, and perhaps
the recollection of that early, ill-starred love
had more than a little to do with his action then.
At the coronation of James, so the story goes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the crown nearly fell from its wearer’s head, a
sinister omen, as many people considered it.
Henry Sidney standing by, promptly averted
the accident, and adjusted the diadem, remarking
with happy audacity “it was not the first
time that a Sidney had supported the crown.”
He became, however, one of the stanchest upholders
of the Revolution, and took with him
to The Hague, in the fateful year of 1688, the
invitation of the plotters to William of Orange.
On the coronation of the latter, Sidney received
the reward of a peerage, being created Viscount
Sidney and Baron Milton, and a few years later,
in 1693, he was made Earl of Romney and also
became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and Warden
of the Cinque Ports. Henry Sidney died in
1704, unmarried. It was, possibly, a tribute
to the memory of a long dead romance—at
least, one is free to think so.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f178'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r178'>178</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Memoirs of Sir John Reresby.” “His Royal Highness
and his duchess came down to York (Aug. 5) where it
was observed that Mr Sydney, the handsomest youth of his
time and of the Duke’s bedchamber was greatly in love with
the duchess, and he might well be excused, for the Duchess,
daughter to Chancellor Hyde, was a very handsome personage
and a woman of Fine Wit. The Duchess on her
part seemed kind to him, but very innocently.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>There was at one time a rumour coupling the
name of the Duchess of York with Henry Savile,
another of the Duke’s grooms of the bedchamber,
and in reference to this report, Pepys piously
ejaculates: “God knows what will be the end
of it!” However, as in the case of Sidney,
there is no positive evidence beyond rumour,
and rumour was not likely to spare anyone who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>had so many enemies as Anne Hyde. Therefore
here, too, a plea of innocence may be
admitted on her behalf.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the ten years from 1661 to 1671 the
Duke and Duchess moved, it seems, little from
London. Besides the progress already described,
made in company with the King and
Queen from Bath to Oxford, the pair were once
at York in 1665, and this, according to Reresby,
seems to have marked the beginning of Henry
Sidney’s passion for the Duchess.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a> Another time
they were at Oxford, and when, like the Court,
they fled from the Plague, they took refuge at
Rufford in Nottinghamshire, being there entertained
by Sir George Savile.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> In return for this
piece of hospitality his uncle, William Coventry,
begged the Duke to procure a peerage for the
host. James referred the matter to his father-in-law,
the Lord Chancellor Clarendon, backing,
however, the appeal by saying that “Sir George
had one of the best fortunes in England, and
lived the most like a great man, that he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>very civil to him and his wife in the North, and
treated them at his house in a very splendid
manner.” Savile afterwards became Marquess
of Halifax, having married Dorothy, eldest
daughter of Henry, Earl of Sunderland (as
already mentioned), who fell at Newbury, and
also, of course, of “Sacharissa.” The Duke
and Duchess were back at St James’s at the time
of the Fire, when the former did yeoman’s
service in the endeavour to check the ravages
of the terrible conflagration, when old St Paul’s,
with its splendid if ruined nave, its beautiful
chantries and tombs, and its lofty spire,
thundered down in a whirlwind of devouring
flame, in company of eighty-nine City churches.
No one worked harder in the face of this
calamity than the King and his brother, nor
showed greater contempt of danger and readiness
of resource, and to the Duke we owe the
preservation of the Temple Church by his order
to blow up the neighbouring houses. To this
Evelyn bears testimony, for he says: “It is
not indeed imaginable how extraordinary the
vigilance of the King and Duke was, even
labouring in person, and being present to command,
order, reward or encourage workmen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A little before this we find Mrs Kate Philips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>known in her own day as the “Matchless
Orinda,” writing to Lady Temple (whom we
know and love as Dorothy Osborne): “I am
glad of the news of the Duchess’ recovery, and
the other victory you mention at Court.” The
recovery is probably from measles, from which
Anne suffered about this time.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a> The victory is
that of Frances Stewart, afterwards Duchess
of Richmond, whom Charles II. loved so madly—for
a time—over her unpopular rival, Lady
Castlemaine. It was a very well known piece
of gossip with which the Court was ringing at
the moment, but one can hardly fancy it to be
particularly welcome nor interesting to Dorothy
Temple, being the manner of woman she was.
A month later poor Orinda was dead of smallpox,
and her poetry, “matchless” as it was
thought, was very soon forgotten.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>As to Anne’s own household, it is significant
that she was said to rule it with decision and
vigilance. One of her ladies was lovely Frances
Jennings, the elder sister of the famous Sarah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>afterwards Duchess of Marlborough, and she,
having married first one of the wild Hamiltons,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
became Duchess of Tyrconnel, and was destined
in her old age to suffer the stings of
poverty and neglect. But early in her career
there were love passages with the Marquis de
Berni, son of Hugues de Lionne, Foreign Secretary
to Louis XIV., and her mistress encouraged
the affair, for it seems that “the Duchess, who
is generally severe on such things, finds the two
so well suited that she is the first to favour
them.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Another of the ladies was Miss Temple, afterwards
Lady Lyttelton, and yet another Lady
Denham, whose story is a sad and dark one.
She had been a Brooke, and had already attracted
the Duke of York when she married Sir
John Denham, who discovering the liaison,
poisoned his wife, at least, so it was suspected.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>But attached likewise to the Duchess’ person
was one who, one cannot but think, must have
been to some extent a support and comfort in
a life that became more and more lonely and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>difficult as time went on. Margaret, daughter
of Colonel Thomas Blagge of Horningsheath
in Suffolk, a loyal Cavalier through the Civil
War, during which he was governor of Landguard
Fort, became maid of honour to Anne,
when a little girl, probably not more than twelve
years of age. The story of her short life has
been told by Evelyn, who watched over her with
the care of a father, and to whom she seems to
have been almost an inspiration.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> As a little
child she had been sent to France with the
Duchess of Richmond (that wayward, beautiful
Mary Villiers, so long and deeply beloved by
Prince Rupert, and whose chivalrous lord had
died broken-hearted for the loss of his master,
Charles I.). The child was then confided to the
care of Lady Guildford, Groom of the Stole to
the queen-mother Henrietta, yet even then we
are told that little Margaret resisted being
taken to Mass. After her return to England
she was confirmed by Gunning, Bishop of Ely,
at the age of eleven, and admitted to Holy
Communion at that early period. It was not
long after this that the Duchess of York asked
for her, and from that time she lived, outwardly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the beautiful, admired, lively maid of honour;
inwardly, a life “hid with Christ.” Evelyn
himself was long unwilling to know much of
her, fancying her “some airy thing that had
more wit than discretion”; and Pepys with much
relish relates that he, in company with Sir John
Smith, dined with her, Mrs Ogle and Mrs Anne
Howard (another maid of honour, afterwards
Lady Sylvius), and that it “did me good to
have the honour to dine with them and look
upon them.” In the whirl of the Court life
Margaret Blagge moves like the “Lady” in
<i>Comus</i>, with spotless garments unsmirched by
the mire through which she treads, and leaving
behind her the ineffable perfume of the “white
flower of a blameless life.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a> She was destined
to die young, in the twenty-sixth year of her
age, the passionately beloved wife of Sidney
Godolphin, the best part of whose life and character
was buried in that early grave. It is
hard to think that he who was to know such a
consecration could write verses to Moll Davis!</p>

could appreciate honesty, the straightforward
mind and transparent truth of Margaret Blagge
must have appealed, in spite of the divergence
of faith which came before the end. For we
hear of the Duchess, that “her frankness was
such that she could as little conceal her antipathies
as she could disguise her affections.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a>

dangerous in her position and must have made
for unpopularity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile the Duke of York, whatever else
he was, was by no means reconciled to a life of
idleness. Pepys, in his character of Naval
Secretary, affirms early in 1664: “The Duke of
York do give himself up to business, and is likely
to prove a noble prince, and so indeed I do from
my heart think he will.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c013'><sup>[189]</sup></a> The former had,
indeed, every opportunity of judging, as his
post brought him necessarily into constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>communication with the Lord High Admiral,
communication of the most intimate kind, for
another time he remarks: “Up and carrying
my wife to Whitehall to the Duke where he
first put on a periwigg to-day, but methought
his hair cut short in order did look very prettily
of itself before he put on his periwigg.”<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a> This
is the last we see of James’ fair curls. King
Charles was turning grey—it was said from
anxiety on account of the Queen’s dangerous
illness—and so assumed a black peruke; therefore
his brother, no less than his whole Court,
must needs do likewise. Another of the honest
secretary’s remarks conveys a certain pathos:
“To St James’s, and there did our business as
usual with the Duke and saw him with great
pleasure play with his little girle like an ordinary
private father of a childe.”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a> If Pepys was what
Thackeray calls a snob, he was at any rate a very
candid one, and perhaps there was, besides,

<p class='c039'>The Duke of York’s work on behalf of the
navy did not begin and end in St James’s or in
the Admiralty buildings near the Tower. Later
we shall see him on board his flagship at grips
with the Dutch, but meanwhile he took care to
visit many ships, and Anne was often with him
on these expeditions. On 19th May 1665, Lord
Peterborough, writing from Harwich, mentions
that he is “going on board to compliment the
Duchess.”<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a> The ship on this occasion was the

<p class='c012'>James was not the only prince of his house to
supplement the laurels won on land by achievements
on the high seas. His cousins, the Princes
Palatine, Rupert and Maurice, had long ago
made their names known as valiant mariners.
A mystery always hung over the fate of Prince
Maurice, who with his ship, the <i>Defiance</i>,
vanished in a great storm.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c013'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Rupert himself
barely escaped with his life in a small boat
when the <i>Constant Reformation</i> was lost with
three hundred and thirty-three men, and this
year, 1665, he set out to attack the Dutch
on the coast of Guinea. He was accompanied
down the river by the King and the Duke of
York, the latter longing to go with his cousin
on this adventure, which, however, came to
nothing, for in spite of the Prince’s efforts the
fleet did not sail. The next year, however, the
long smouldering rivalry with the States General
came to a head, and war was declared. A fleet
to proceed against the Dutch was assembled at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Gunfleet, the Duke, as Lord High Admiral, being
in supreme command, and Prince Rupert,
Admiral Lawson and Lord Sandwich admirals
under him. Charles, by the way, had given the
settlement of New Amsterdam to his brother,
and it was henceforth known as New York, the
Dutch land settlement having been originally
taken by James I.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>In April the fleet aforesaid began the blockade
of the Zuyder Zee, but after a fortnight it was
forced to return for provisions, though it had
been supposed to be victualled for five months.
Prince Rupert, who came to be known as the
seaman’s friend, was highly indignant with
Pepys and other Admiralty officials on this
occasion, but the debts on the fleet had really
begun under the Commonwealth and had
mounted to such an extent that it was impossible
to pay the pursers.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c013'><sup>[196]</sup></a> Finally, after the loss of
Hamburg to the Dutch, the English fleet again
set sail and headed for Southwold Bay, meeting
the enemy on 1st June. For two more days
they pursued them, till they succeeded in
getting their wind-gauge, fourteen miles from
Lowestoft, and the battle actually began at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>half-past three on the afternoon of 3rd June,
Prince Rupert leading the van, the Duke of
York the centre, and Sandwich the rear. To
James it was probably as keen a satisfaction as
it was to his cousin, to vindicate on the sea the
reckless valour which in his early youth had
distinguished him on land, and it was with the
knowledge of his contempt for personal danger,
that the Duchess contrived to convey a strict
injunction to all his servants to do whatever
lay in their power to restrain him on this occasion.
It was during the action that the Dutch
copied the English tactics of turning, but they
found the latter ready for them, their rear and
van changing positions. However, the English
sustained some disaster by means of a mistake
in the new signalling orders, and a false move
on the part of Sandwich, who allowed his
squadron to become mixed with the enemy.
Nevertheless the victory remained with the
English, for by seven o’clock the Dutch were in
full flight, fourteen of their ships being taken
and four thousand men slain. It was even said
that they might have been annihilated but for
conflicting counsels on the part of the English,
and a mistake for which, guilty or innocent, the
Duke had to suffer. A council had been held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>on board his flagship, when some of the captains
asked him to discontinue the pursuit. This,
however, James refused, giving, on the contrary,
the order to press on all sail, and bidding his
servants to call him when the Dutch should be
sighted. He then went below, and during the
night, Brouncker, who was Gentleman of his
Bedchamber, going to the admiral, Sir William
Penn, bade him shorten sail. Penn, believing
this order to come from the Duke, obeyed it,
but in the morning James came on deck, and at
once questioned the admiral, who promptly
accused Brouncker. The latter held his tongue,
but his master, declaring he had given no such
order, dismissed him from his service. It was
at the time considered significant that the Duke
did not further punish him, but on the other
hand, it may be noticed that James’ own
account of the matter is that he intended to
punish Brouncker by martial law, but that the
House of Commons took up the question, and by
impeaching the culprit made any further action
on his own part impossible. Lord Montague
seems to have believed that the Duke did give
the order, but Brouncker when before the House
did not even pretend that his master had done
so. Whatever were James’ faults, his character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>for courage and candour make his own account
the more probable. In any case he was the
ultimate victim, for he was withdrawn from the
command of the navy on the ground that it
exposed <i>him</i>, the heir presumptive, to too much
danger.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c013'><sup>[197]</sup></a> The service thereby lost a valuable
head, for he had worked hard to establish it on
a permanent footing, and had already evolved
some order out of chaos. Yet this department
of duty was not, at least at this period
of his life, what he most desired, or was
most congenial to him. Again on this subject
Pepys writes: “He [Mr Coventry] tells me
above all of the Duke of York that he is
more himself and more of judgment is at
hand in him in the middle of a desperate
service than at other times, as appeared in
the business of Dunkirke, wherein no man
ever did braver things or was in hotter
service at the close of that day, being surrounded
with enemies. And though he is a
man naturally martial to the highest degree,
yet a man that never in his life talks one word
of himself or service of his own, but only that
he saw such and such a thing and lays it down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>for a maxim that a Hector can have no
courage.”<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c013'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the succeeding year that Prince
Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle achieved
their great victory over the Dutch off the North
Foreland on St James’s Day, 25th July.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c013'><sup>[200]</sup></a> In
that terrible and stubborn fight the English had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>eighty-one ships of the line and eighteen fireships,
while the enemy, under the command of
the famous De Ruyter, had eighty-eight ships,
ten yachts, and twenty fireships. After this
engagement the Prince Palatine carried fire and
sword from Scheveningen along the coast of
Holland, but he was compelled to return for
want of provisions, of which neglect he complained
bitterly. Secretary Pepys, however, a
second time the scapegoat, retorted that the fleet
had been brought back in bad condition, the
Prince protesting that he could have continued
the campaign six months longer if his ships had
been properly provisioned. The Dutch fleet
was enabled by his evasion to refit, and were
joined by the French in the Channel.</p>

<p class='c012'>All this while the Duke of York, detained at
home, was chafing with impatience and trying
to fill up his time with such matters as came to
hand, and giving his attention to each. Once
Pepys writes: “I to Whitehall to a Committee
for Tangiers where the Duke of York was, and
I acquitted myself well in what I had to do”
(the worthy Samuel, in spite of occasional fits
of self-accusation, had always an excellent
opinion of himself). “After the Committee
up I had occasion to follow the Duke into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>his lodgings into a chamber where the Duchess
was sitting to have her picture drawn by Lilly,
who was there at work. But I was well pleased
to see that there was nothing near so much resemblance
of her face in his work which is now
the second if not the third time as there was of
my wife’s at the very first time. Nor do I
think at last it can be like, the lines not being
in proportion to those of her face.” To the end,
ill as he behaved to and by her, Pepys was proud
of his wife’s beauty and really fond of her, and
this naïve expression of his satisfaction is almost
pathetic.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c013'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Somewhere about this time Lady Fanshawe
was returning from Spain, on the death of her
chivalrous and deeply mourned husband, to
make at last her home in England, and she was,
as his merits entitled her, graciously received
by the King, whom he had served so long and
faithfully. On this occasion she presented two
dozen “amber skins” and six dozen pairs of
gloves to the King, the Queen, the Duke and his
little son the Duke of Cambridge, who was,
alas! destined soon to follow his brother.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c013'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
The Duke of York lent Lady Fanshawe the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><i>Victory</i> frigate to bring the rest of her goods and
people from Bilbao at the end of March 1667.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was for that period, an age which set such
store by signs and portents, a strange defiance
of omens that impelled the parents to give what
would seem a fatal title to three successive
children, none of whom were fated to survive
infancy. Through the ten years which succeeded
her marriage, Anne’s nursery at St James’s
Palace was filling only to be emptied. One
after another of the sons so eagerly and fondly
welcomed was destined to fade quickly out of
this life, “to find the taste bitter and decline
the rest”; the ducal coronets were to fall from
the small heads too weak to bear so heavy a
burden. Of the eight children born to James,
Duke of York, and Anne his wife, only two
daughters survived to play their parts thereafter
on the great stage of history for good or
for evil. The mother, however her heart was
wrung, as it must have been, carried an undaunted
front through those years of loss and
bereavement, and held her place resolutely in
the very forefront of Court and festival, a conspicuous
and dominating figure always.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her home throughout her married life, as
before said, was St James’s Palace, a house which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>must have enshrined many memories for James
himself. There he had been brought up as a
child, there he had been in his boyhood a State
prisoner with the brother and sister, now both
passed away, there his father the martyr-king
had spent the last night of his life before the
winter morning walk across the Park to Whitehall
and the block before the Banqueting House,
and there his body had lain that night, watched
by a little band of faithful servants, before the
burial at Windsor. There also James and his
wife always kept the anniversary of that day,
the 30th January, year by year, as it came
round, in sorrowful remembrance.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a goodly habitation, and indeed
rivalled the great rambling palace near the river
in splendour of furniture and decoration and
the treasures it contained.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c013'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Yet another picture from Secretary Pepys’
busy pen is shown us here.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c013'><sup>[204]</sup></a> One spring day, he
tells us, he came thither to dine “with some of
the maids of honour at the Treasurer’s House,”
and thereafter he found “the Duke of York
and the Dutchess with all the great ladies sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>upon a carpet on the ground, there being no
chairs, playing at ‘I love my love with an A
because he is so and so, and I hate him with an
A because of this and that,’ and some of them
but particularly the Dutchess herself and my
Lady Castlemaine were very witty.” A childish
game, it seems to us, yet the scene has a certain
charm and grace, invested too with piquancy
by the ladies’ readiness. In other days at
The Hague and Breda, under the approving eyes
of the “Winter Queen” and her own Princess
Mary, with Spencer Compton and Harry Jermyn
to applaud, Nan Hyde had learnt to hold her own
in jest and repartee, and now that she too was
a princess, she had not forgotten the trick, but
still shone in swift retort and happy invention.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>There, too, in the ancient palace, when night
came the tables would be set for basset, the
favourite game; and at them Duchess Anne,
eager in her imperious way, would set down broad
pieces on the hazard, staking on the cast now a
thousand pounds, now fifteen hundred. One
night she even lost twenty-five thousand pounds,
and it became to her an absorbing passion, to
be inherited by her second daughter.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c013'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Over
and over again in later days did James II. pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the debts of the Princess Anne, himself the reverse
of extravagant, being in this the antithesis
of his elder brother.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is an unlovely side of Anne Hyde’s perplexing
character, and one displays it with
reluctance. Certainly it was a strange outcome
of her narrow upbringing in her father’s careful
household. Of her thirst for gain Pepys has a
word to say: “Mr Povy do tell me how he is
like to lose his £400 a year pension of the Duke
of York which he took in consideration of his
place that was taken from him. He tells me
that the Duchess is a divil against him and do
now come like Queen Elizabeth and sits with the
Duke of York’s council and sees what they do,
and she crosses out this man’s wages and prices
as she sees fit for saving money, but yet he tells
me she reserves £5000 a year for her own spending
and my Lady Peterborough by and by tells
me that the Duchess do lay up, mightily,
jewels.”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c013'><sup>[206]</sup></a> This was written in 1668, and it
may or may not be true. In a succeeding
chapter a different and totally contrasting
aspect of Anne Hyde must be unfolded, one to
be dwelt upon, in one direction, with far greater
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Whatever</span> might be the consternation of the
Chancellor at his elder and favourite daughter’s
stolen match, however great his anger and disappointment
at the failure of the duty and confidence
which he felt she owed him—and there
is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the feeling
he manifested on the disclosure—it is nevertheless
evident that the affectionate terms on which
father and daughter lived, suffered but a very
short eclipse.</p>
<p class='c012'>The Duke of York himself treated his father-in-law
with unvarying respect and consideration,
and to Anne the latter was always a welcome
visitor. For a time, at least, it would seem that
Clarendon was on the crest of the wave. High,
and deservedly so, in his King’s favour, reconciled
to his once inveterate foe, the queen-mother,
his daughter established on the steps
of the throne, his position appeared altogether
unassailable. Still, as in the days before the
marriage, the Chancellor and his daughter spent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>much of their time together, and at some time
during those happy days, before the breaking
of the storm that was to overwhelm the
wisest head in England, we find the record of a
pretended wager between them, a piece of very
innocent fooling which no doubt served its
purpose of amusement for the moment:</p>

<p class='c011'>Before very long, however, the heart for such
things was wanting, even if the time was available.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a hard task to gauge the inveterate and
bitter malignity which pursued the Chancellor
to his final exile from England. Whatever were
the faults in his public service and administration,
it could at least be said of Edward Hyde
that “he was in the Court of Charles II. almost
the only man who lived chastely, drank moderately,
and swore not at all,”<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c013'><sup>[208]</sup></a> and that with his
lifelong friends, Ormonde and Southampton,
he “projected into this reign” “the high-toned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>virtues of the old Cavalier stock.”<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c013'><sup>[209]</sup></a> These, and
the friendship already mentioned—just as long
and steadfast—with John Evelyn, should stand
the memory of Clarendon in good stead, putting
aside those brilliant gifts which he used so unsparingly
in the service of his sovereign. Of these,
Horace Walpole, no mean critic, declares that “for
his comprehensive knowledge of mankind he
should be styled the Chancellor of human nature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The dark clouds were beginning to gather
about Hyde as early as 1662, though possibly
only the few persons who were conversant with
all State secrets were cognisant of the fact. In
one of de Wiquefort’s despatches he says of the
Chancellor: “He has a strong party against
him who will make the King jealous, and will
be favourable to the Queen in order to oppose
the Duchess of York.” If the party against
Clarendon was strong, it must have been a
small one at that time, but it is instructive to
see that already two factions were in the forming,
trying to establish a rivalry between the
two ladies, though they themselves were entirely
innocent in the matter, but at any rate no one
was so likely to suffer between the contending
parties as Clarendon himself. In 1663, Digby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Earl of Bristol, whose character should not have
secured any particular confidence, attacked the
Chancellor, bringing against him a charge of
high treason which, however, at that period
fell to the ground.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c013'><sup>[210]</sup></a> But as time went on the
deep-laid prejudice against him spread and
spread like a canker. He had unhappily tried
the unsuccessful experiment of hunting with
the hounds and running with the hare, for he
had endeavoured to reconcile the Presbyterian
malcontents by the Act of Indemnity and the
Romanists by the Act of Uniformity, thereby
satisfying neither party. In this way he had
unfortunately succeeded in making enemies
in all directions. He was “steady for the
Church against Dissenters and Papists alike,”<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c013'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
and consequently both parties hated him.
His blameless life, too, was a tacit reproof of
the vices of the Court, and his chief foe, Buckingham,
took full advantage of the fact.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c013'><sup>[212]</sup></a> He and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>his boon companions were accustomed to say
to the King, with a sneer: “There goes your
school master!”<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c013'><sup>[213]</sup></a> But it was above all the
irrepressible Barbara Villiers, Lady Castlemaine,
beautiful, unscrupulous, evil in thought and
deed, who joined with others no less guilty in
hounding the Chancellor to his disgrace and so
depriving the King of a minister who, if not
perfect, had at any rate done him and the realm
great and lasting service. Meanwhile, while
all their discontent and malice were seething
under the surface, but not yet openly active,
Clarendon, in execution of the plan he had entertained
from the time of the Restoration, set
about building his new house in 1664. We have
previously seen that he established himself
temporarily at Worcester House in the Strand,
and that it was there that both his daughter’s
marriage and the birth of her elder son took
place, but he had never intended to remain
there, and it was not very long before he acquired
a site which suited him. At the time of the
public announcement of Anne’s marriage, York
House at Twickenham, originally York Place,
was given to her father, who was accustomed
to stay there when the King was at Hampton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Court, and the Duchess’ daughter Anne, afterwards
queen, was born there.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c013'><sup>[214]</sup></a> But it was in
London itself that the Chancellor proposed to
build his new house, and he received a grant
from the King of certain Crown property. It
lay west of Burlington House, on the site of
Bond Street, Stafford Street and Albemarle
Street, extending eastwards to Swallow Street,
its western boundary being, however, uncertain.
There, then, was built Clarendon House,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c013'><sup>[215]</sup></a> facing
the top of St James’s Street, and occupying the
whole site of Stafford Street. It stood back
from Piccadilly, then newly named, having projecting
wings with a turret in the centre, and
Evelyn calls it, with some probable exaggeration
“the first palace in England.”<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c013'><sup>[216]</sup></a> It is said
that 74 Piccadilly was built of a portion of the
materials.</p>

the most useful, graceful and magnificent house in England,
and I except not Audley End, which, though larger and full
of gaudy and barbarous ornament, does not gratify judicious
spectatore.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Rather later than the erection of Clarendon
House, the City of London gave the Chancellor
a lease of the Conduit Mead, which is now
covered by New Bond Street and Brook
Street, and from which Conduit Street takes
its name.</p>

<p class='c012'>The building of this magnificent palace, no
doubt intended by Clarendon to be a home for
his children’s children, excited a positive storm
of wrath. The sale of Dunkirk had lately been
completed, and the mob chose to believe that
the house was built with Dutch money, though
there is no proof that Clarendon ever received a
penny. Pennant asserts boldly that the stones
used in its erection had been intended for the
rebuilding of old St Paul’s, long in a half-ruinous
state, which work had been set on foot some time
before the Great Fire made all such intentions
abortive for the moment. Nicknames were
freely bestowed. Holland House, in allusion to
supposed bribes from the Dutch; Dunkirk House
for the same reason; Tangier House, because
the Chancellor had obtained the town of Tangier
for England, and no one wanted it. His employment,
during the Plague, of three hundred
workmen on his building operations, though
done with the best intentions, only raised
another outcry.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1667, the unlucky year when the Dutch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>sailed up to Gravesend, a mob proceeded to
break the windows of Clarendon House with
the usual fatuous want of reason on such occasions,
and setting up a gibbet before the gates,
inscribed on it the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three sights to be seen:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Dunkirk, Tangier, and a barren Queen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c041'>In fact the town was deluged with lampoons in
the fashion of the day. Another couplet put
it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God will avenge too for the stones he took</div>
      <div class='line in1'>From aged Paul’s to build a nest for rooks.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c041'>Andrew Marvell, too, chose to take up his
parable on the subject, and dipped his mordant
pen in bitterer gall than usual:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here lie the sacred bones</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Yet again, in his “Clarendon’s House-warming”
are the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He had read of Rhodope, a lady of Thrace,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who was digged up so often ere she did marry,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And wished that his daughter had had so much grace</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To erect him a pyramid out of her quarry.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c039'>The stately house which from the first attracted
so much unfriendly attention had but
a short life, and its ill luck dogged it to the end.
Evelyn, who saw the first stone laid, also saw
the pulling down of the whole edifice. Clarendon’s
sons, Lord Cornbury and his brother
Laurence, afterwards Lord Rochester, leased it
to their father’s friend the Duke of Ormonde,
who, by the way, was driving up St James’s
Street on his way to Clarendon House when the
notorious Colonel Blood made his desperate
attempt to kidnap and assassinate him. Later
still, after the Chancellor’s death, the house was
sold to Monk’s son, the second Duke of Albemarle,
who called it after himself, but subsequently
sold it again to a syndicate; and it was
finally demolished in 1683 by a certain Sir
Thomas Bond, “to build a street of tenements
to his undoing.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c013'><sup>[218]</sup></a> He, at least, vindicated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>loyalty, for having been Controller of the Household
to the queen-mother, he went into exile
in after years in the train of King James II.
His name, of course, survives in the present
Bond Street, which occupies part of the site
of Clarendon House, as Albemarle Street recalls
the second appellation of the Chancellor’s
house.</p>

the 25th October 1664 he added: “We shall

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Several reasons, as previously stated, could be
given for Clarendon’s steadily increasing unpopularity
and for his final disgrace, but in
1667 he was for the second time impeached.
Among the articles of this second accusation of
high treason were “The taking money for the
King’s marriage with Portugall,” “The marrying
his daughter to the Duke of Yorke,” “The
obstructing all other marriages for the King.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c013'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>As regards the second of the indictments
we know that Hyde was entirely innocent
from first to last. The third seems to point at
the often suggested plan of a divorce from
Catherine. The King himself wrote privately
to Ormonde that his real reason for parting with
his old servant was “the Chancellor’s intolerable
temper,”<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c013'><sup>[225]</sup></a> but it is also said that he deeply
resented the latter’s action in counteracting a
divorce by bringing about the stolen marriage
of “La Belle Stuart” to the Duke of Richmond,
seeing that he (Charles) at one time contemplated
getting rid of his wife to marry the lovely,
wild, childish girl who, for the moment, imprisoned
his vagrant fancy.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c013'><sup>[226]</sup></a> His covert irritation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and impatience were diligently fanned by
those about him, headed by Buckingham, who
used his great gifts and entire want of scruple,
with deadly effect, to compass the undoing of
his foe. It is possible that Clarendon had at
first displayed his personal influence too openly,
for though Charles from sheer indolence would
allow himself to be governed with fatal facility,
he was nevertheless, like many people of a
like temperament, very unwilling that the fact
should be known. As to the charge of bribery
urged so often, and with such bitter pertinacity,
there is absolutely no proof of any kind of its
truth. Clarendon was accused of receiving
bribes right and left, of knowing that the needy
spendthrift King received them from his astute
cousin Louis XIV. Of all this, it must be repeated,
Hyde’s enemies could bring no proof,
and at any rate his fall certainly heralded the
worst period of the reign of Charles II. “The
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune” followed
fast upon each other. Clarendon’s old
friend, Lord Southampton, one of the best and
wisest of his generation, had died not long
before. In August the King sent for the Seals
to be delivered up, and a few days later the
faithful Evelyn came to visit the disgraced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>minister, and “found him in his bedchamber
very sad.” “He was my particular kind friend
on all occasions,” adds the diarist loyally, and
one can fancy that his presence may have
brought a little momentary comfort to the
bruised heart. There was a yet heavier blow
to fall, and the cup of sorrow to be filled to the
brim. On 8th December, some months later,
Pepys records that he saw the Duchess of York
at Whitehall “in a fine dress of second mourning
for her mother, being black edged with
ermine.” To Clarendon himself the loss of the
faithful wife who had shared his poverty and
exile beyond the sea, as well as his short-lived
prosperity, came as a crushing misfortune
among all the other burdens pressing upon him
on every side. A few pathetic words written
in July from Clarendon House allude to this
sorrow as impending: “Being in noe good disposition
the last weeke, by reason of my Wife’s
great Sicknesse.”<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c013'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>We see Evelyn again visiting his friend about
this time, and finding “him in his garden at
his new-built palace, sitting in his gowt wheel
chayre and seeing the gates setting up towards
the north and the fields. He looked and spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>very disconsolately.” It was no wonder.
Everything was crumbling round him like the
wall of a falling house. The fortune he had
built up through so many strenuous years
was toppling over, honour and reputation
were smitten, and he sat—alone. The “new-built
palace” could yield him now but little
solace, and forth from it he must go, like
Wolsey, “naked to his enemies.” Truly he
must have said to himself, as he looked
round him in utter loneliness: “Vanity of
vanities.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile in the ancient palace at the foot
of the hill, not many hundred yards away,
sorrow of another kind was brooding.</p>

<p class='c012'>To the Duchess of York herself, this year
was especially marked by grief and misfortune.
In one direction there was the keen mortification
caused by the Duke’s short-lived passion
for Lady Denham, whose tragic and mysterious
death has been already recorded; in another
the blow inflicted by the disgrace and final
exile of her father—and this of itself must have
been a sore trouble, considering the close affection
between them. Sadder still came the death
of her mother and of her young children.
Andrew Marvell’s unsparing pen was again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>busy, and surely no crueller couplet was ever

stands out here in sombre relief.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c013'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Across the Park, which he has already done
much to improve, having laid out the Mall and
planted avenues, comes King Charles at his
usual swift pace. He has been, according to
his custom, feeding the ducks, of which he is
very fond. Two or three courtiers keep up
with him as best they may, and a crowd of little
dogs run and dance round him, snapping at
each other. Now and then the King throws a
careless word or two to his attendants, who
laugh dutifully, or try to cap them, as the case
may be. Down another path from the direction
of Spring Gardens,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c013'><sup>[230]</sup></a> where he now lives—it
used to be in the Barbican<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c013'><sup>[231]</sup></a>—advances a tall
figure carrying himself with a certain stately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>swing. Those keen quick eyes and high aquiline
features can only belong to Prince Rupert, fresh
perhaps from some of his experiments, the transmuting
of silver, and the like. As he takes off
his wide plumed hat in a sweeping salute and
bows profoundly, the King nods cheerfully,
glad of the meeting, glad of any distraction.
A few desultory words—he has shot a duck, it
seems, and one of the dogs retrieved it; then
he seems suddenly to remember that his
brother’s boys are ailing. “Let’s go and see
Cambridge and Kendal,” he says with a stifled
yawn, as he passes his arm through that of his
cousin. It reads callously, but Charles is a
man of strange and unexpected reserves, and
he may feel more than he allows to be seen.
So the pair walk on under the spreading trees,
while the King’s attendants fall back to a more
respectful distance. The Prince Palatine somehow
always inspires something like awe. It is
but a little way, and they come to the ancient
grave palace, above which the standard with
the leopards and lilies, and the crescent for
difference, hangs its heavy folds in the still air.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another and greater King is entering the door
unseen—for two dying children lie under that
goodly roof. Kendal and Cambridge are indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“riding post” to the edge of the dark
river into whose waters those small feet are
already almost plunged, and over them, tearless
for all her bleeding heart, hangs the mother.
Is it for sin of hers—is it a judgment on ambition—that
no living son of her blood may carry
on the line of English royalty? Can she give
nothing, do nothing, to avert the coming
doom?<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c013'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Someone, no doubt, tells the King that his
errand is vain. The frail little lives are passing
out of sight, and he turns away silent. He is
moved and sorry. He is good-natured, even
kind-hearted, when he remembers to be, but
Prince Rupert’s noble face is clouded and the
luminous eyes are misty, for no sorrow appeals
to him in vain.</p>

<p class='c012'>But worse evils are coming on England than
even the loss of the seed-royal. The Dutch
fleet is in the river, and coming up to Gravesend,
intent on vengeance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles II. has been unsparingly blamed for
this disaster, but he was not altogether guilty.
After the terrible visitations of the Plague and
the Fire, he greatly impoverished himself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>help the many destitute sufferers, refusing to
press the Parliament to pay the sums voted for
supplies, when those disastrous years made
them fall short.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c013'><sup>[233]</sup></a> This led to the necessity of
laying up ships which should have been kept in
commission, contrary to the advice of the Duke
of York and the emphatic warnings of Prince
Rupert. No doubt the King had also yielded
to the persuasions of Louis XIV., backed by
Henrietta Maria, whose advice was always unlucky,
and France was at this time but too ready
to pull the strings in the background. Meanwhile
another division of the Dutch, advancing
up the Medway, had forced the boom laid across
it for protection, and had actually burnt three
men-of-war.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the great palace of Whitehall all is in
uproar, and wild confusion is reigning.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c013'><sup>[234]</sup></a> Rumours
of fire and sword lose nothing by transmission
from one to another. Some of the maids of
honour believe anything and everything, even
an immediate sack of London. Beautiful,
brazen Castlemaine, carefully dishevelled like
a Bacchante, is bewailing herself and hysterically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>protesting that she will be the first to be
torn in pieces. Probably the person most unmoved
by the clamour and its cause is the King
himself, looking on cynically from the outside,
as it were, with the quality of aloofness which
has always stood him in good stead. And now,
as we know, the mob, always prejudiced, always
fickle, just because the Dutch are in the Thames,
streams off tumultuously to Clarendon House
and breaks the windows with great enthusiasm.
To the builder and owner of that ill-omened
mansion such an incident was probably but a
slight and momentary aggravation. Clarendon
himself writes from Whitehall on 14th June:
“I had writt this farr, the case is much altred
by the Dutch Fleete entring into the Ryver and
tryumphing there to our great damage and how
farr it may extend farther we yett know not;
the particulars I leave to others (but upon the
whole) matters not though a peace may be
bought deare and usually when an unreasonable
price asked for it it is an infallible sign that it
is not to be had yet a peace in this conjunction
would be very reasonable.”<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c013'><sup>[235]</sup></a> This letter
was originally partly written in cypher. The
Chancellor’s signature is very tremulous, testifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>possibly to agitation of mind easily conceivable.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Thus for the Chancellor the end had truly
come. A career of singular if varying brilliance
was closing, alas! ingloriously. At his impeachment,
his son-in-law, the Duke of York,
who had never failed to stand by him since their
connection, and who now wished to soften the
blow, sent his old friend Bishop Morley to the
fallen minister to say that the King wished
him to leave the country. It needed only this.
He over whose youth Edward Hyde had watched
so faithfully, to the utmost of his power, had
done with him. He did not want to see his face
any more, and he never did see it. Clarendon
bent his head to the storm, and submitted.
Perhaps his strong heart broke then, and nothing
else mattered very much. At any rate
he obeyed the royal mandate, the last he was
to receive, and before the year was out he had
left England, as it proved, for ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>He went first to Calais, then to Rouen, covering
ground that must have been very familiar
to him in earlier days. At Evreux, where he
stayed for a time, his life was actually attempted
by some English sailors, on the grounds that he
had sold his country and robbed them of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>pay.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c013'><sup>[236]</sup></a> This danger he escaped, and later, with
the restlessness born of despondency and lack
of occupation, he wandered south to Montpellier,
proceeding thence to Moulins. Finally, however,
he retraced his steps to Rouen. It was
nearer, after all, to England; and there, at no
great distance from the country he loved so
well, he died in December 1673.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c013'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p>EDWARD, EARL OF CLARENDON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It is a pitiful story. Whether Clarendon was
entirely blameless of all the accusations against
him, it is useless to speculate, but at least it
must be conceded that from the first he had set
before him high ideals, and if he fell short of
these, it was no more than many—nay most—had
done. It was an age, pre-eminently, when
it was said that every man had his price. If so,
then Edward Hyde’s was a very high one; but
it is much pleasanter and indeed more reasonable
to believe in his innocence, as such belief is far
more consonant with his character as it is presented
to us by his contemporaries. And at
least he knew heavy griefs. Estranged more
and more as time went on from the daughter
he loved so deeply, severed altogether from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and from his sons, driven in disgrace from his
country to spend in exile a lonely old age, the
close of Clarendon’s story presents a very
sorrowful picture, and if one were inclined to
moralise, preaches an eloquent sermon on the
vanity of human greatness. But it is not likely
that the ex-Chancellor himself needed any such
reminders. He had seen too much of the
mutability of all things here, to be quite unprepared
for vicissitudes, and he had at last
learnt how to face with dignity the trials which
he was destined to suffer. For one thing we
certainly owe him a debt of gratitude, namely,
for his “History of the Rebellion.” In that
noble record he has painted for us, as no
other hand could have done it, the actors in
that great drama, perhaps the greatest ever
presented on the stage of English history,
and has made them live for all time to his
readers.</p>

<p class='c012'>This great and important work Clarendon
wrote at a house in Swallowfield in Berkshire,
which was the home of his eldest son’s second
wife, Flower, the widow of Sir William Buckhouse.
Lord Cornbury’s first wife had been Theodosia,
the daughter of the gallant and hapless
Arthur, Lord Capel, one of the most perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>heroes of a time which produced not a few
such.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c013'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

the Duke of Buckingham, afterwards Bishop of Rochester.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>As before said, if Clarendon was indeed guilty
of himself receiving bribes, or of the knowledge
that the King’s hands were not clean in this
respect, there exists no proof of either, and if
he needed or desired any revenge for his disgrace
and broken fortunes, he might have found
it in the decadence of the government of his
country which immediately followed. He had
at least one satisfaction—that his royal son-in-law
had voted against his sentence of banishment,
but it was probably only an aggravation
of his trials that Bishop Morley, whom he had
been wont to call “the best man alive,” was
involved in his disgrace. On this account
the bishop was removed from his post of spiritual
director to the Duchess of York, an office which
he had filled with little intermission since the
Flemish days when he had found a shelter under
Hyde’s hospitable roof.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c013'><sup>[239]</sup></a> But such a reverse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>was inevitable. The great tree in its fall was
destined to drag down with it the lesser ones
whose roots were twisted with its own. “None
of us liveth to himself,” are words which hold
good of more than Clarendon and his friends.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f239'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r239'>239</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Morley was translated to Winchester he took Izaak
Walton and his son with him, and the former died there in
1683. Winchester House at Chelsea was bought by Morley,
and belonged to the See until Bishop Tomlin’s day. (Dean
Plumptre’s “Life of Ken.”)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>So Edward Hyde passes out of the arena of
his day and country, a conspicuous figure
through many stormy years, and his place
knows him no more. His rival, Buckingham,
remains to hold the stage a little longer, and in
some eyes he may be all-sufficient, since Reresby
can call him “the finest gentleman of person
and wit I think I ever saw”; and King Louis,
against whose judgment there can surely be no
appeal, pronounces him “the only English
gentleman” he had ever seen. In the light
of such shining attributes, the sombre colours
wherein Chancellor Hyde is invested retire altogether
into the shade; yet perhaps when the
two figures are placed side by side in the
estimation of a later age, opinions may be
reversed as to which is after all the finer
gentleman. The blood of the Hydes was to
the full as ancient as that of the Villiers, and for
the rest who can doubt which served with the
stancher devotion God and the king, or lived
the more blameless and unstained life? Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>great names stand out from the record of the
England of that day, names of which she has
reason to be proud—Falkland, Hopton, Bevil
Grenville, Southampton, Capel—yet to his
honour it may be said that Edward Hyde is not
unworthy of a place among them.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>We</span> come now, in the course of her story, to the
most momentous epoch in the life of Anne Hyde,
the period, namely, of her conversion to the
Church of Rome. And here it must be noted
that she was in no respect ignorant, nor uninstructed
in the dogmas of her own Communion.
It has been shown that in her early youth she
was placed by her father under the teaching of
Morley, during the time when he lived, an
honoured guest, in Hyde’s household in the
days of exile at Breda.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c013'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

friend of such great and noble souls as Hammond
and Sanderson, Chillingworth and Falkland.
He had ministered to Charles I. in his captivity
at Newmarket, and had stood on the scaffold
with Capel. At The Hague he became an
honorary chaplain to the Queen of Bohemia,
who knew merit when she saw it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>From the time when Morley assumed the
spiritual directorship of the twelve-year-old
daughter of his protector Hyde, he taught her
to use regular confession, which she seems to
have done unswervingly, and her confidence in
him may be gauged from the fact that as soon
as her position as Duchess of York was firmly
established, she chose him to continue her guide
“in those things that concerned her spiritual
and everlasting condition.” It has been already
noticed that at one time Morley had been suspected
of Calvinism, on which account he was
disliked by Laud; and the story is told of
him, that when asked what Arminians held, he
answered with some acerbity that they held
but bishoprics and deaneries. But his later
close friendship with the saintly Ken seems to
establish his orthodoxy, and we find him preaching
against Presbyterianism.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c013'><sup>[241]</sup></a> He, for his part,
describes his pupil Anne as being “as devout
and charitable as ever I knew any of her age
and sex.” After her marriage she carefully
kept the canonical hours of the “Public Service
of God in her Chapel with those of her family.”
Besides this, she was a regular and devout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>communicant. “And always,” says the bishop,<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c013'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
“the day before she received she made a voluntary
confession of what she thought she had
offended God in, either by omission or by
commission, professing her sorrow for it, and
promising amendment of it, and kneeling down
she desired and received absolution in the form
and words prescribed by our Church. This
for her devotion. And as for Charity, she did
every time she received the Sacrament, besides
five pounds in gold she gave at the altar, she
gave me twenty pounds to give to such as I
thought had most need of it, and did best deserve
it. This was her ordinary and constant
way of expressing her charity. But that which
she did at other Times and upon extraordinary
Occasions I believe was very much more, especially
in the Time of the Great Plague. To conclude
I remember she told the late Archbishop
of Canterbury (Sheldon) and me when we were
both together with her that if she did not so
much in point of Charity as it was fit for her to do,
it should be his fault and mine, and not hers.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c013'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

the way, fearlessly remained at Lambeth throughout the Plague”

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>It is strange and perplexing to read this
obviously honest testimony side by side with
the dismal tales of light conduct, of avarice, of
gluttony, of reckless gambling, which were
freely told; and it is impossible to refrain from,
at least, trying to discount some of these
scandals, knowing as we do the age and state
of society which gave birth to them. It may
be objected that the King, whose way of life was
so unhappily notorious, steadily communicated,
himself, in the Chapel Royal on the great
festivals; but from the account just quoted, it
seems evident that Duchess Anne’s reception
of the Divine Mysteries was no perfunctory act.
For the rest, impossible as it is to reconcile
apparent contradictions, one can only fall back
on the truism of the contradictions of poor
human nature itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>With regard to the change of faith presently
to be traced, as late as 1667, at the time therefore
of her father’s banishment, Bishop Morley
persists in describing Anne as still “a zealous
Protestant,” “and zealous to make Protestants,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>though this assertion may be coloured by
the writer’s prepossessions. Her relations with
Morley and also with Sheldon brought her
into contact with the mysterious adventurer
Ferdinand de Macedo.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c013'><sup>[244]</sup></a> Sir John Bramston,
Clarendon’s old friend, had been accused by
this person, prompted by Henry Mildmay,
Bramston’s political enemy, of having changed
his religion. Macedo himself (a Portuguese),
who had declared himself a convert from the
Roman Church, was recommended to the
Duchess as an object of charity. She forthwith
allowed him a yearly pension of thirty pounds,
and spoke for him to her two advisers, who, in
their turn, each made him an allowance of ten
pounds, the Bishop of Winchester, moreover,
placing him at Christ Church and even advancing
a further sum of thirty pounds to buy
necessaries. However, the man for whom so
much was done was found to be utterly unworthy,
for he drank and gambled, and even
had a discreditable brawl with a Frenchman
whom he threw downstairs. The Dean of
Christ Church and Canon Lockey, at the end of
their patience, very naturally appealed to
Morley to remove him, as a cause of grave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>scandal. The latter, as well as Sheldon, promptly
withdrew the allowance aforesaid, but out of
good nature said little or nothing of the matter
to the Duchess, who, however, hearing something
of it from others, questioned the bishop
closely, and being satisfied that her bounty
was misapplied, took it away. Macedo, who
probably traded on the fact that he was a
Portuguese, and thus a fellow-countryman of
the Queen, was quite unabashed at being unmasked,
and with great effrontery announced
that he had been turned out of the university
for testifying against Popery and the Prayer
Book. The exasperated Morley called him,

<p class='c011'>This was written from York where the writer
was with her husband on one of their “progresses,”
and the prelate to whom it was
addressed was no other than the saintly Cosin.
During his exile at Charenton, near Paris, he
had been much engaged in controversy, on one
occasion, with the Prior of the English Benedictines,
whom he had defeated by the force of
“much learning and sound reasoning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the Restoration he had returned to his
deanery of Peterborough, where he was the
first person to use the Restored Prayer Book
in the cathedral, but the same year was consecrated
Bishop of Durham, where he died
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in 1672,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c013'><sup>[247]</sup></a> in the seventy-eighth year of his
age. He displayed extraordinary munificence
throughout his episcopate, and one of his bequests
recalls a very real need of that period,
for he left a sum for the redemption of Christian
slaves.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>For some time after the incident of Macedo’s
exposure, the Duchess of York seems to have
been to all intents and purposes a loyal churchwoman,
and indeed to Morley himself she never
owned the change in her faith, even though
she stayed at the episcopal palace at Farnham
after she wrote the letter of recantation which
will be noticed later.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover Blandford, Bishop of Worcester,
succeeded Bishop Morley in her household
after the latter’s resignation when involved
in Clarendon’s disgrace; therefore up to that
time she had certainly not severed her connection
with the Church of her baptism.</p>

<p class='c012'>There now comes the difficult task of seeking
the motive for so grave a resolution.</p>

<p class='c012'>Burnet, who is never apt to attribute the
best motives for any action, declares that Anne
took the step in the desperate hope of winning
back her husband’s affections, alienated from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>her by the affair with Henry Sidney. She, so
says Burnet, “lost the power she had over him
so entirely that no method she could think of
was likely to recover it except one.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c013'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>But to this assertion Anne’s own avowal,
which carries the stamp of conviction, gives the
lie; and besides, as the Duke of York had not
then, nor did for some time after, openly abjure
the Anglican Church, his wife’s strong common-sense
must have told her that her own apostasy
could only have a disastrous effect on the future
fortunes of both. That she did not renounce
her Church lightly is certain. She had read
much on the subject, and among other books she
was conversant with Heylin’s “History of the
Reformation.”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c013'><sup>[249]</sup></a> There is no evidence that the
Duke’s sister-in-law, the Queen, influenced her
in any way. Indeed, poor Catherine was not
a person to exercise such a quality, nor to bring
pressure to bear on anyone, devout and conscientious
though she was from first to last.
Besides, Duchess Anne was too strong willed
and resolute to bow to any one’s ruling,
least of all to that of one so yielding, placable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and self-effacing as the neglected wife of
Charles II.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It is impossible to lay a finger on the precise
period when Anne first began to waver in her
allegiance to the Church, but the falling off was
first suspected in 1669, and not before. When
her neglect of the Holy Eucharist was first
noticed by him, Morley spoke to her plainly
and faithfully on the point, when she gave him
an evasive answer, alleging as deterrent reasons
the state of her health and the claims of business,
and at the same time declared that no Roman
priest had ever spoken to her of these questions.
She also voluntarily promised the bishop, that
if any scruples should occur to her, she would
at once tell him of them. This, however, so he
afterwards told Burnet, she never did. It is
strange and sad that, after so many years of
complete confidence, Anne should shrink from
consulting this faithful adviser, but there were
reserves in her character which were manifested
to the end. Possibly a certain pride had something
to do with it, a reluctance to own herself
capable of change in any direction, and she
preferred to wrestle with her perplexities
unaided and unthwarted. At last the King
became conscious of his sister-in-law’s continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>abstention from Holy Communion, and questioned
his brother on the subject.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c013'><sup>[250]</sup></a> The Duke
at once owned the fact of his wife’s conversion,
and her intention of being received into the
Roman Communion.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c013'><sup>[251]</sup></a> On this he was peremptorily
charged to keep the momentous secret,
at all hazards, for the King, always astute and,
when he chose to be, far-seeing, was too well
aware of the temper of the English people to
run the risk of making public a matter of such
importance. It was in August 1670 that Anne
was formally reconciled to the Church of Rome
by Father Hunt, a Franciscan, who with Lady
Cranmer, her lady-in-waiting, and one Dupuy,
a servant of the Duke, were for a time the sole
depositaries of this matter; for it does not
appear that even the Queen was at this time,
at any rate, a party to the secret. It must be
borne in mind as giving weight to the King’s
prohibition, that Anne was the wife of the heir
presumptive to the Crown, and the mother of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>his apparent successors, and this rendered her
faith, in the eyes of the nation, of the last
importance.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is so reasonable to expect that a person
always Bred up in the Church of England, and
as well instructed in the Doctrine of it, as the
best Divines, and her capacity could make her,
should be liable to many censures for leaving
That, and making herself a member of the
Roman Catholic Church, to which, I confess,
I was one of the greatest enemies it ever had;
That I chose rather to endeavour to satisfy my
friends by reading this Paper then to have the
trouble to answer all the questions that may
dayly be asked of me. And first, I do protest
in the presence of Almighty God, That no Person,
Man or Woman, Directly nor Indirectly, ever
said anything to me (since I came into England)
or used the least endeavour to make me change
my Religion. It is a blessing I wholly owe to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Almighty God, and I hope the hearing of a
Prayer I dayly made Him, ever since I was in
France and Flanders, Where seeing much of the
Devotion of the Catholicks, (though I had very
little myself) I made it my continual request to
Almighty God: That if I were not, I might
before I died be in the true Religion: I did not
in the least doubt, but that I was so, and never
had any manner of scruple till November last,
when reading a book called the History of the
Reformation, by Doctor Heylin which I had
heard very much commended, and had been
told, if ever I had any doubt in my Religion,
that would settle me: Instead of which, I
found it the description of the horridest Sacriledges
in the World: and could find no reason
why we left the Church, but for Three the
most abominable ones that were ever heard of
amongst Christians. First, Henry the Eighth
Renounced the Pope’s Authority because he
would not give him leave to part with his Wife
and marry Another in her life time: Secondly
Edward the Sixth was a Child and govern’d by
his Uncle who made his Estate out of Church
Lands: and then Queen Elizabeth, who being
no Lawful Heiress to the Crown could have no
way to keep it but by renouncing a Church that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>could never suffer so unlawful a thing to be
done by one of Her Children. I confess, I
cannot think the Holy Ghost could ever be in
such Counsels and it is very strange that if the
Bishops had no design but (as they say) the
restoring us to the Doctrines of the Primitive
Church, they should never think upon it how
Henry the Eighth made the Breach upon so unlawful
a Pretence. These scruples being raised,
I began to consider of the difference between the
Catholicks and Us, and Examin’d them as well
as I could by the Holy Scriptures, which though
I do not pretend to be able to understand, yet
there are some things I found so easie that I
cannot but wonder I had been so long without
finding them out. As the Real Presence in
the Blessed Sacrament, the Infallibility of the
Church, Confession, and Praying for the Dead.
After this I spoke severally to Two of the best
Bishops we have in England, who both told me,
there were many things in the Roman Church
which (it were very much to be wished) we had
kept. As Confession, which was no doubt commanded
by God; That Praying for the Dead
was one of the Ancient Things in Christianity.
That for their parts they did it Daily, though
they would not own it; but afterwards pressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>one of them very much upon the other Points,
he told me That if he had been bred a Catholick
he would not change his Religion, but that
being of another Church, wherein he was sure
were all things necessary to Salvation, he
thought it very ill to give that Scandal, as to
leave that Church, wherein he had received his
Baptism. All these Discourses did but add
more to the desire I had to be a Catholick, and
gave me the most terrible Agonies in the World,
within myself. For all this, fearing to be rash
in a matter of that Weight, I did all I could
to satisfie myself, made it my Daily Prayer to
God to settle me in the Right, and so went on
Christmas Day to receive in the King’s Chappel,
after which I was more troubled than ever, and
could never be in quiet till I had told my desire
to a Catholick who brought a Priest to me,
and that was the First I ever did Converse with
upon my Word. The more I spoke to him, the
more I was Confirm’d in my design, and, as it is
impossible for me to doubt of the words of our
Blessed Saviour, who says the Holy Sacrament
is his Body and Blood, so I cannot Believe, that
He who is the author of all truth and who has
promis’d to be with His Church to the End of
the World would permit them to give that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Holy Mystery to the Laiety but in one kind, if
it were not Lawful so to do.</p>

<p class='c029'>“I am not able, or, if I were, would I enter
into Disputes with any Body, I only in short
say this for the changing of my Religion, which
I take God to Witness I would never have done
if I had thought it possible to save my Soul
otherwise. I think I need not say, it is any
Interest in this World leads me to it; it will be
plain enough to every body, that I must lose
all the Friends and Credit I have here by it;
and have very well weighed which I could best
part with, my share in this world or the next;
I thank God I found no difficulty in the Choice.</p>

<p class='c029'>“My only Prayer is, that the poor Catholicks
of this Nation may not suffer for my being of
their Religion; That God would but give me
Patience to bear them, and then, send me any
affliction in this World, so I may enjoy a Blessed
Eternity hereafter.”<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c013'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The inherent weakness and insufficiency of
the arguments put forward by the writer in this
paper are manifest at once, but her sincerity can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>scarcely be impugned. Indeed, throughout her
career this quality was always conspicuous in
Anne Hyde, to an extent which often, in her
relations with those about her, made for unpopularity.</p>

<p class='c012'>It must be mentioned in this place that John
Evelyn disbelieved the authorship of this letter.
Writing to Bishop Morley as early as 1681,
he says:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Father Maimburg has had the impudence to
publish at the end of his late Histoire du Calvinisme
a pretended letter of the late Duchess of
York intimating the motives of her deserting
the Church of England, amongst other things
to attribute it to the indifference, to call it no
worse, of those two bishops upon whose advice
she wholly depended as to the direction of her
conscience and points of controversy. ’Tis the
universal discourse that your Lordship is one
of these bishops she mentions, if at least the
letter be not suppositious, knowing you to have
been the most domestic in the family, and one
whom her Highness resorted to in all her doubts
and spiritual concerns, not only during her
former circumstances, but all the time of her
greatness to the very last. It is therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>humbly and earnestly desired (as well as indeed
expected) amongst all that are concerned for
our religion and the great and worthy character
which your Lordship bears, that your Lordship
would do right to it, and publish to all the world
how far you are concerned in this pretended
charge and to vindicate yourself and our Church
from what this bold man would have the world
believe to the prejudice of both. I know your
Lordship will be curious to read the passage
yourself and do what becomes you upon this
signal occasion, God having placed you in a
station where you have no great one’s frowns
to fear or flatter, and given you a zeal for the
truth and for his Glory. With this assurance
I humbly beg y<sup>r</sup> Lordship’s blessing.”<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c013'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We have already seen that Morley distinctly
stated to Burnet that his pupil the Duchess had
never asked his counsel in her difficulty, therefore
he could not have been either of the bishops
whom she cited, and a marginal note to Anne’s
letter states, moreover, that the bishops referred
to were Sheldon and Blandford. Evelyn, it is
true, does not give the ground for his scepticism
in the authenticity of the letter. He may or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>may not be right, but the fact of James’ order
for its publication would seem to stamp it as
genuine, even if the writer had been prejudiced,
or mistaken, in her references to the bishops.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anne’s dutiful and regular attendance on
religious observances naturally drew attention
to the neglect of them which she manifested in
later years, but the secret was well kept, and
though suspected in some quarters, did not leak
out to the world in general in her lifetime.</p>

<p class='c012'>We can, without much difficulty, picture the
bitter heart-searchings, the doubt, the reluctance,
intensified by failing health, which must have
accompanied this momentous change; but we
must at least give her credit for the absolute
candour of her convictions.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was one person who was deeply and
specially affected by this departure on her part.</p>

<p class='c012'>On her father, the exiled Chancellor, the news
of his daughter’s change of religion inflicted a
crushing blow, stanch as he had always shown
himself to be to the Anglican Church.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c013'><sup>[255]</sup></a> His
recollections of the great civil strife in which he
had been so deeply involved were inextricably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>bound up with loyalty and devotion to that
Church, as well as to the master who had undoubtedly
suffered for her, and thus by that
sacrifice secured her continuity. To Hyde, as
to many others of his time and circumstances,
the scaffold at Whitehall stood as a witness to
the faith, invested with the glory of that most
sacred memory. And now from the hand that
was best beloved to him, came the wound that
must rankle till the end.</p>

“Her father was more troubled at her uncertainty than his
own misfortunes.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>It is quite probable that the Chancellor had
already suspicions of leanings towards Rome
on the part of the Duke of York, and had to a
great extent trusted in his daughter’s strength
of character and influence as a deterrent; so
that the unexpected defection on her part
would be regarded by him as a disaster for the
country no less than for herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this unhappy juncture Clarendon therefore
took up the pen, which in his hand was
so trenchant a weapon, and addressed both
husband and wife, separately, in words which
deserve the strongest admiration and respect.</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>S<sup>r</sup></span>,—I have not p’sumed in any matter to
approach yo’ Royall p’sence Since I have been
marked with the Brand of Banishment, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>should still with the same awe forbear the
p’sumption if I did not believe myselfe bound by
all the Obligations of Duty to make this address
to you. I have been acquainted to much with
the p’sumption and impudence of the times in
Raising false and scandalous Imputations and
reproaches upon Innocent and worthy persons
of all qualities to give any credit to those loud
whispers which have been long scattered abroad
concerning your Wives being shaken in her
religion. But when those Whispers break out
into noise most publick Persons begin to report
that the Dutchess is become a Roman Catholick.
When I heard that many worthy Persons of unquestionable
Devotion to your Royall Highness,
are not without some fear and apprehension of
it, and many Reflections are made from them
to the prejudice of your Royal Person, and even
of the King’s Majesties, I hope it may not
misbecome me at what distance soever to cast
myself at your Feet, and beseech you to look to
this matter, and to apply some Antidote to
expel the Poyson of it. It is not possible your
Royall Highness can be without zeal and Entire
Devotion for that Church for the Purity and
Preservation whereof your blessed Father made
himself a Sacrifice and to the Restoration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>whereof You have contributed so much yourself,
and which highly deserves the King’s Protection
and Yours since there can be no possible
defection in the hearts of the People whilst due
Reverence is made to the Church. Your Wife
is so generally believed to have so perfect Duty
and Intire Resignation to the Will of your Highness,
that any defection in Her from Her Religion
will be imputed to want of Circumspection
in you and not using your Authority, or to your
connivance. I need not tell the ill consequences
that such a mistake would be attended with, in
reference to your Royale Highness, and even to
the King himself whose greatest security (under
God) is in the affection and Duty of his Protestant
subjects, your Royall Highness well knows
how far I have always been from wishing that
the Roman Catholicks should be prosecuted
with severity but I less wish it should ever be
in their power to be able to prosecute those who
differ from them since we well know how little
moderation they would or could use. And if
this which People so much talk of (I hope without
ground) should fall out, it might very
probably raise a greater storm against the
Roman Catholicks in general than modest Men
can wish, since after such a breach any Jealousies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>of their presumption would seem reasonable.
I have written to the Dutchess with the freedom
and affection of a troubled and perplexed Father.
I do most humbly beseech your Royall Highness
by your Authority to rescue Her from
bringing a Mischief upon You and herself that
can never be repaired; and to think it worthy
your wisdom to remove and dispell those reproaches
(how false soever) by better Evidence
than Contempt, and hope you do believe that
no severity I have or can undergo, shall in any

<p class='c015'>“You have much reason,” so run the words,
“to believe that I have no mind to trouble
you or displease you, especially in an argument
that is so unpleasant and grievous to myself;
but as no distance of place that is between us, in
respect of our Residence or the greater distance
in Respect of the high condition you are in, can
make me less your Father or absolve me from
performing those obligations which that Relation
requires from me, So when I receive any
Credible Advertisement of what reflects upon
you, in point of Honour, Conscience or Discretion,
I ought not to omit the informing You of
it, or administering such advice to You as to
my understanding seems reasonable, and which
I must still hope will have some Credit with
You, I will confess to You that what You wrote
to me many Months since, upon those Reproaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>which I told you were generally reported
concerning your defection in Religion,
gave me so much satisfaction that I believed
them to proceed from that ill Spirit of the Times
that delights in Slanders and Calumny, but I
must tell you, the same report increases of late
very much, and I myself saw a Letter the last
week from Paris, from a person who said the
English Embassador assured him the day before,
that the Dutchess was become a Roman
Catholick, and which makes great Impression
upon me, I am assured that many good men
in England who have great Affection for You and
Me, and who have thought nothing more impossible
than that there should be such a change
in You, are at present under much affliction
with the observation of a great change in your
course of Life and that constant Exercise of the
Devotion which was so notorious and do apprehend
from your frequent Discourses that you
have not the same Reverence and Devotion
which You use to have for the Church of
England, the Church in which You were
Baptized, and the Church the best constituted
and the most free from Errors of any Christian
Church this day in the world, and that some
persons by their insinuations have prevailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>with You to have a better Opinion of that which
is most opposite to it, the Church of Rome, than
the integrity thereof deserves. It is not yet in
my power to believe that your Wit and Understanding
(with God’s blessing upon both) can
suffer you to be shaken further than with
Melancholick reflections upon the Iniquity and
wickedness of the Age we live in, which discredits
all Religion, and which with equal
license breaks into the Professors of all, and
prevails upon the Members of all Churches, and
whose Manners will have no benefit from the
Faith of any Church. I presume You do not
intangle Yourself in the particular Controversies
between the Romanists and us, or think Yourself
a competent Judge of all difficulties which
occur therein; and therefore it must be some
fallacious Argument of Antiquity and Universality
confidently urged by men who know less
than many of those you are acquainted with,
and ought less to be believed by you, that can
raise any Doubts or Scruples in you, and if You
will with equal temper hear those who are well
able to inform You in all such particulars it is
not possible for you to suck in that Poyson
which can only corrupt and prevail over you
by stopping Your own Ears and shutting Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>own Eyes. There are but two persons in the
World who have greater authority with You
than I can pretend to, and am sure they both
suffer more in the Rumour, and would suffer
much more if there were ground for it, than I
can do, and truly I am as likely to be deceived
myself or to deceive you as a man who endeavours
to pervert You in Your Religion; And
therefore I beseech You to let me have so much
Credit with You as to perswade You to Communicate
any Doubts or Scruples which occur
to you before You suffer them to make too deep
an Impression upon You. The common Argument
that there is no Salvation out of the
Church and that the Church of Rome is the only
true Church is both irrational and untrue;
there are many Churches in which Salvation
may be attained as well as in any one of them,
and were many even in the Apostles time otherwise
they would not have directed their epistles
to so many Severall Churches in which there
were different Opinions received and very different
Doctrines taught. There is indeed but
one Faith in which we can be saved; the stedfast
belief of the Birth, Passion and Resurrection
of our Saviour; and every Church that
receives and embraces that Faith is in a state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>of Salvation, if the Apostles Preach true Doctrine,
the reception and retention of many
errors do’s not destroy the Essence of a Church,
if it did, the Church of Rome would be in as
ill, if not in a worse Condition than most other
Christian Churches, because its Errors are of a
greater Magnitude and more destructive to
Religion. Let not the Canting Discourse of
the Universality and Extent of that Church
which has as little of Truth as the rest, prevail
over You, they who will imitate the greatest
part of the World, must turn Heathens, for it is
generally believed that above half the World is
possessed by them, and that the Mahometans
possess more than half the remainder; There
is as little question that of the rest which is
inhabited by Christians, one part of four is not
of the communion of the Church of Rome, and
God knows that in that very Communion there
is as great discord in Opinion, and in matters
of as great moment, as is between the other
Churches. I hear you do in publick discourses
dislike some things in the Church of England,
as the marriage of the Clergy, which is a point
that no Roman Catholic will pretend to be of the
Essence of Religion, and is in use in many places
which are of the Communion of the Church of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Rome, as in Bohemia, in those parts of the Greek
Church which submit to the Roman; And all
men know, that in the late Council of Trent, the
Sacrament of both kinds, and liberty of the
clergy to marry, was very passionately press’d
both by the Emperor and King of France for
their Dominions, and it was afterwards granted
to Germany, though under such conditions as
made it ineffectual; which however shows that
it was not, nor ever can be look’d upon as
matter of Religion. Christianity was many
hundred years old, before such a restraint was
ever heard of in the Church; and when it was
endeavoured, it met with great opposition, and
was never submitted to. And as the positive
Inhibition seems absolutely unlawful so the
Inconveniences which result from thence will
upon a just disquisition be found superior to
those which attend the liberty which Christian
Religion permits. Those Arguments which are
not strong enough to draw persons from the
Roman Communion into that of the Church of
England, when Custom and Education, and a
long stupid resignation of all their faculties to
their Teachers, usually shuts out all reason to
the contrary, may yet be abundant to retain
those who have been baptized, and Bred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Instructed in the Grounds and Principles of
that Religion which are in truth not only
founded upon the clear Authority of the Scriptures,
but upon the consent of Antiquity and
the practice of the Primitive Church, and men
who look into Antiquity know well by what
Corruption and Violence and with what constant
and Continual Opposition, those Opinions which
are contrary to ours, crept into the World, and
how unwarrantably the Authority of the Bishop
of Rome, which alone supports all the rest,
came to prevail, who hath no more pretence
of Authority and Power in England, than the
Bishop of Paris and Toledo can as reasonably
lay claim to, and is so far from being matter of
Catholick Religion, that the Pope hath so much
and no more to do in France or Spain or any
other Catholick Dominion, than the Crown and
Laws and Constitution of several Kingdoms
gave him leave, which makes him so little (if at
all) considered in France, and so much in Spain;
And therefore the English Catholicks which
attribute so much to him make themselves very
unwarrantable of another Religion than the
Catholick Church professeth and without doubt
they who desert the Church of England, of
which they are Members, and become thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>disobedient to the Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws
of their Country and therein renounce their
Subjection to the State as well as to the Church
(which are grievous sins) had need to have a
better excuse than the meeting with some
doubts which they could not answer, and less
than a manifest evidence that their Salvation is
desperate in that Communion cannot serve their
turn; and they who imagine they have such an
evidence, ought rather to suspect that their
Understanding hath forsaken them, and that
they are become mad, than that the Church
which is replenished with all Learning and
Piety requisite, can betray them to Perdition.
I beseech you to consider (which I hope will
overrule those ordinary Doubts and Objections
which may be infus’d into you) that if you
change your Religion, you renounce all Obedience
and Affection to your Father, who loves you
so tenderly that such an odious Mutation would
break his heart, you condemn your Father and
your Mother (whose incomparable Virtue, Piety
and Devotion hath plac’d her in Heaven) for
having impiously Educated you; and you declare
the Church and State, to both which you
owe Reverence and Subjection, to be in your
Judgment Antichristian; you bring irreparable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>dishonour, scandal and prejudice to the Duke
your Husband to whom you ought to pay all
imaginable Duty, and whom I presume is much
more precious to you than your own life, and all
possible ruine to your Children of whose company
and conversation you must look to be
depriv’d, for God forbid that after such an
Apostacie, you should have any power in the
Education of your Children. You have many
Enemies, whom you herein would abundantly
gratifie, and some Friends, whom you will
thereby (at least as far as in you lies) perfectly
destroy; and afflict many others who have
deserved well of you. I know you are not inclined
to any part of this mischief, and therefore
offer those Considerations, as all those
particulars would be the infallible Consequence
of such a Conclusion. It is to me the saddest
Circumstance of my Banishment that I may not
be admitted in such a season as this, to confer
with you, when I am confident I could satisfie
you in all your Doubts, and make it appear to
you that there are many Absurdities in the
Roman Religion inconsistent with your Judgment
and Understanding, and many Impieties
inconsistent with your Conscience; so that
before you can submit to the Obligations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Faith, you must divest yourself of your Natural
Reason and Common Sense, and captivate the
distastes of your own conscience to the Impositions
of an Authority which hath not any
pretence to oblige or advise you. If you will
not with freedom communicate the Doubts
which occur to you, to those near you of whose
Learning and Piety you have had much experience,
let me Conjure you to impart them to
me, and to expect my answer before you suffer
them to prevail over you. God bless you and
yours.”<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c013'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is a long, stilted, tedious letter, read under
present-day conditions, and the methods used
by the writer in argument hardly commend
themselves, but, especially towards the end, the
anxiety of the father’s heart is made quite
evident. The great lawyer marshals all the
force of controversy at his command in the
vain hope of influencing his daughter and
reversing the decision so dreaded by him.
He appeals to her heart, no less than to her
head.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c013'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Husband, children, friends—he places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>before her the possible loss of all, the harm that
may accrue to them; he leaves, as far as may
be, nothing unsaid, nothing untried. It is
curious and significant that one sentence reveals
the fact that Clarendon was aware of his
daughter’s unpopularity in certain quarters.
“You have many enemies,” he says, as he points
to the triumph which her change of faith would
afford them as one reason, if an unworthy one,
against it. The pathetic significance of this
last letter is driven home all the more forcibly
for this reason—that she to whom these weighty
words were addressed, doubtless with many
prayers that they might prevail, was destined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>never to read them. Death stepped in, and for
ever sealed the page.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f258'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r258'>258</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is well known that when Kings and Princesses of the
Blood make an alliance with a subject, their arms are not
put into the Royal Escutcheon, nor did ever the late
Duchess of York call the Lord Chancellor father, nor did
ever the late King James call the Earls of Clarendon and
Rochester brothers, nor the Princesses Mary and Anne term
them as uncles. Indeed the late Chancellor, when he wrote
letters of advice to the late Duchess in relation to her changing
her religion made use of the style of Daughter, which
indeed he ought not to have done” (“Aylesbury Memoirs.”
Roxburghe Club).</p>
<p class='c012'>“At Queen Anne’s accession, the second Lord Clarendon,
her uncle, came to see her, and simply said, ‘I wish to see
my niece’—which meant that her brother was now King,
and she but a usurper. He had also rebuked her for her
flight to Nottingham at the time of her father’s reverses.
On her part Anne would not receive her uncle without
the oath of allegiance, and this he refused” (“Queen
Anne and her Court.” P. F. Williams Ryan.)</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>As already mentioned, the fact of the
Duchess of York’s conversion was not known for
some time later, though suspicion was soon busy
on the subject, and the Court, in high excitement,
buzzed with the matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was probably a trial to any one so outspoken
and downright as Duchess Anne to
conceal a fact of which she was certainly not
ashamed, but the commands of the King conveyed
to her through his brother, were peremptory
and stringent, and she consented to hold
her tongue for the present. As things turned
out there was soon no reason for silence, except
in so far as her change might have affected
others. So the royal convert practised her new
faith in silence. The chaplains shook their
heads as Sunday after Sunday the Duchess
turned away from “God’s Board.” Morley
was no longer at her right hand, and the others
spoke only aside to each other—not to her.
Anne was never very approachable, and she
had long learned the value of her position in
checking inconvenient inquiries. Sweet-faced
Margaret Blagge grieved silently, but she
was very young, and dared not speak, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>if the exigencies of her post would have
allowed it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of York, after his exercise of authority
and the message he had transmitted from
the King, said nothing. The time for confidence
between those two was long past, and though
he secretly sympathised with his wife in the
step she had taken—his own subsequent action
is warrant sufficient for that—estrangement
had become a habit, and the party wall dividing
husband and wife needed a stronger force still
to throw it down. Perhaps a word or two may
have passed between the new convert and
Queen Catherine. It is more than likely, indeed,
but the latter, timid and shrinking, was
not constituted to uphold any one, and besides,
she was far too much in awe of the King, too
pathetically anxious to please him, to be capable
of running counter to any commands he might
choose to enforce. She could, and probably
did, give approbation, sympathy, for what they
were worth, but of these Anne stood in no need,
then nor at any other time. Her position was
one of “lonely splendour,” and she had long
learnt to stand alone and carve out her own
path. No doubt the lesson had been a bitter
one, but she had learnt it once for all. During
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>this year, moreover—1670—the Duke was
seriously ill,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c013'><sup>[259]</sup></a> and this fact may have aided in
the estrangement from his wife, or at any rate
in the withholding of complete confidence from
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in other respects a momentous year for
the whole royal house in England, and that in
a way to be presently described. An unexpected
and sinister development was to change
in some degree the aspect of things.</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>As</span> one writes these two simple words “The
End” across the heading of this final chapter,
one is reminded to pause and reflect upon them.</p>
<p class='c012'>The end—of what? Of a brief but splendid
pageant—of a heavy burden of sorrow—of a
life of resolute, indomitable pride?</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Respice finem</i>—Consider the end. Surely, of
all who have attained to high places, or have
longed after them, Anne Hyde should have
taken for her own this motto, should have read
and marked and inwardly digested it.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet, would it have availed anything?
Does it ever avail?</p>

<p class='c012'>When our eyes are dazzled by the light that
for the moment seems all-pervading, they cannot
see the shadows that lie beyond, nor would they
even if they could.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, then, we look on at the removal of a
figure, concrete enough in her own time and to
her own contemporaries, but to us curiously
elusive, even visionary. It is strange, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>for one occupying the position she did for ten
years of English history, Anne, Duchess of
York, had left personally a very slight impression
on that position. The place that knew her
was so soon content to know her no more, the
gap she left was so quickly filled.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not to her but to her children that we
must look for any consideration of her life as
important. No doubt in the early days in
Flanders Edward Hyde watched the unfolding
of his daughter’s keen intelligence with hope
and confidence as a factor in her future. It was
afterwards that her “vaulting ambition” was
destined to “o’erleap itself,” and so weigh her
down under “the burthen of an honour into
which she was not born.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It does not need much reflection to point the
moral here, it is obvious enough and sorrowful
enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the summer of the year 1670, the
same year which saw the Duchess of York’s conversion
to the Church of Rome, the King’s only
remaining sister, the Duchesse d’Orléans, paid
what proved to be her last and also her most
momentous visit to her native country, a visit
that might have been fraught with such disastrous
consequences to England. It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>quite apparent whether Henrietta herself fully
appreciated all that her mission entailed—the
mission she accepted so light-heartedly at the
hands of her magnificent brother-in-law, the
French king. She had never displayed any
great aptitude for diplomacy, nor indeed much
interest in such questions, but had been content
to float on the surface of life like an airy butterfly,
a creature of sun and shower. This being so,
it was a very easy task indeed for Louis to use
her as his tool and complaisant go-between.
Madame and her elder brother, we know, loved
each other very deeply; he—Louis XIV.—probably
loved nobody at all, at least this is the
conclusion which seems forced upon us, therefore
he stood in the far stronger position.
Madame believed, as it was easy to make her
believe, that in carrying out King Louis’ instructions
she was doing great things for France;
that for her sake Charles II. must agree to
proposals of which possibly she did not fully
grasp the magnitude, but which tended to place
England under the heel of her neighbour. It
must also be here borne in mind that Henrietta
was to all intents and purposes a Frenchwoman.
She had been brought up from infancy in France,
and that country commanded all her sympathies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and prejudices. Most likely she regarded England
as an alien country, which had slain her
father and driven her family into exile for years,
and which would be all the better for drastic
treatment, if it happened to be inflicted. Moreover,
it was the excuse for a welcome excursion,
a visit to her brothers, a short respite from the
society of Monsieur, which was now always an
infliction, a fact which can scarcely be wondered
at. Therefore Madame started on her journey
in high spirits, in consonance with the season
of summer which was just now flinging its gifts
over the earth and shedding beauty in its path,
the beauty of serene skies, of waving grass, of
radiant flowers.</p>

<p class='c012'>This visit of Madame’s was, it is true, to be
but a flying one. She was not even to come to
London at all, and a plea was put forth for this
marked abstention which carries us back to the
year of the Restoration, and her mother’s bitter
attitude towards the marriage of the Duke of
York. It seemed very evident that even now,
at the distance of ten years after that marriage,
the haughty Stuart princess could not bring herself
to meet her English sister-in-law on equal
terms. It was clearly impossible, so we are
told, that Madame should now come to London,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“for she will not yeild ye place to ye Dutchesse
of Yorke, nor can it be allowed that the
Dutchesse of York should yeild it unto her.”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c013'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
It was the question fought for years before, to
be revived anew, it is hard to see why, on this
occasion. However, on consideration a compromise
was finally arranged by certain wise
counsellors, the method adopted being that of
transferring the place of meeting to Dover,
where, fortunately, it seemed that matters of
precedence might, in a measure, be conveniently
waived, to the satisfaction of all parties therein
concerned. It was furthermore settled for the
nonce by the decision that the Duchess of York
should yield the “pas” to Madame in “this
Kingdome,” because it was remembered that
the Duke of Orleans had always taken care to
give it to his cousin the Duke of York when in
France.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>So, this point being finally decided, the King
and his brother set out for Dover, there to meet
their sister, and they were followed thither later
by the Queen and the Duchess of York.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the town proceeded there as well; that is,
everybody who was anybody. The wits and
the beaux, the beauties of the Court, “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>King’s musicke” and the Duke’s players, “all
the bravery that could be got on such a
sudden,”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c013'><sup>[261]</sup></a> grave statesmen and people who
had nothing grave about them, besides those
who went frankly for amusement and no more.
The Dover road, the most famous road in the
kingdom, which had known through the far-back
centuries the possessors of the most
honoured names passing in long procession to
and fro, which had seen the victors and vanquished
of the hundred years’ war, was alive
with travellers of all conditions. Coaches,
horsemen, pack-horses, waggons with provisions,
waggons with fine clothes, tramping beggars,
itinerant musicians, broken soldiers ready for
any fray or wrangling for a groat. It was
a seventeenth-century Canterbury pilgrimage
which yet lacked a Chaucer for its worthy
chronicler.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Although Monsieur could not be said to display
at this time any overweening attachment
to his wife, he apparently entirely disapproved
of this visit to England, the real object of which
was concealed from him, as he could not be
trusted with any matter of importance, and it
was afterwards remembered that he said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>some of his intimate friends that he did not
think the Duchess would live very long. Moreover
an astrologer is reported to have said that
he (d’Orléans) would have several wives, which
prophecy was probably highly agreeable to
him. He accompanied Henrietta for part of her
journey, however, joining her before Dunkirk,
from which port she embarked on the 24th May.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c013'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
It is pleasant to record that when Madame did
meet the despised sister-in-law at Dover, she
was kind to her, in spite of the difficulty as to
precedence before noticed.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c013'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Many plans of pleasure were set on foot,
possibly to divert attention from the political
business which was the real reason for Madame’s
visit.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day King Charles took his sister for
an expedition to Canterbury, where they saw
a ballet and comedy, and were entertained
at a collation in the hall of St Augustine’s
Abbey. Other diversions followed in due
course, helped by the radiant summer season

meetings.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c013'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>To many it was, no doubt, a halcyon time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>The pomp and splendour, the sparkle and gaiety
of Whitehall were transferred to the ancient
castle on the beetling white cliff for the moment,
and the centre and core of everything, the chief
luminary among many stars, was the fair
princess whose short life, even now drawing
swiftly to its close, had known such strange
vicissitudes. Cradled in the very vortex of
civil strife during Essex’s siege of Exeter;
brought up as a child, for a time, at any rate, in
grinding poverty, when she shared her mother’s
dreary life of exile; then, in early youth, the
supreme jewel of the most brilliant Court in
Europe, its splendid king at her feet, she was
now, though none could have foreseen it, at the
very threshold of her mysterious doom. Only a
few days in England, a few happy days to be
remembered hereafter fondly and regretfully
by those who saw her then, and, her mission
fulfilled, the mission which, as has been
said, she possibly did not fully comprehend,
Madame set sail on her return.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c013'><sup>[265]</sup></a> For the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>time, if either could have known it, she bade
farewell to the brother whose affection for her
was perhaps the strongest and purest feeling
of his cynical, careless, insouciant nature. The
letters he wrote to her testify to this fact, invested
as they are with a charm all their own,
and endorsed with a certain pathos, for “my
deare, deare sister.” This final parting off
Dover was a sorrowful one to both. The King
and the Duke of York sailed for some distance
with their sister before they could summon resolution
to tear themselves away, and when the
moment of farewell could no longer be delayed,
the King held Henrietta long in his arms, embracing
her again and again, while she clung
to him, weeping passionately.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c013'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Alas for them!
Only a week or two are to pass, and she, the
beloved princess, the English rose, as she might
well be termed, is cut down in her prime of
beauty. The sombre picture of that scene unveils
itself before us, dark and portentous. Out
of the agonised death chamber at St Cloud
comes the great Bossuet, who has borne the
Last Sacraments to the dying girl, and exhorted
her to the very end. As he sweeps past the
shrinking, horror-struck crowd without, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>surveys them with unsparing contempt, but his
funeral sermon in the Chapel Royal rings down
the centuries: “O nuit désastreuse, O nuit
effroyable, où retentit tout-à-coup comme un
éclat de tonnerre, cette étonnante nouvelle:
Madame se meurt! Madame est morte!”<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c013'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
The suspicion of poison always raised in those
days on the occasion of an unexpected death
may be unfounded in this case; we cannot
tell, but the attendant circumstances were
sad and ominous enough without that. The
crass stupidity of the doctors, the callous indifference
of Monsieur, the decorous sorrow of
King Louis—once it would have been something
more—all make up the setting of a grim tragedy,
only relieved by the courage and resignation
of Henrietta herself.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c013'><sup>[268]</sup></a> Over in England there
was deep and bitter grief at the news: Charles
himself broke down into passionate tears, but
after a while the memory of Madame remained
only as a fair dream in the recollection of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>who had known her. Nevertheless she had
performed the work which King Louis had given
her to do in England, and the secret treaty was
concluded.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c013'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Charles was, when expedient, to profess the
Roman Communion; he was to join France,
when so required, in a war against the United
Provinces, and for these services he would
receive two million livres, and six thousand
men in case of any insurrection at home.
Here, then, was the kernel of the matter.
Money was always lacking, the hunger for it
altogether unsated; even the portion of Zealand
which was promised out of the future conquest
of the Dutch was little in comparison, and the
English King might have been induced to make
further promises for a corresponding amount of
hard cash.</p>

<p class='c012'>The tragic death of the Duchess of Orleans
was also destined at the time to affect the family
of her brother the Duke of York in quite another
direction.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Duchess Anne has been accused, among other
failings, of the unlovely propensity of eating too
much, and this habit was certainly inherited by
her younger daughter and namesake.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c013'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Whether
from this, or from some other cause, the Lady
Anne of York very early contracted a weakness
of the eyes, a complaint, moreover, which lasted
to the end of her life. For the cure of this
disorder the parents had taken the precaution
of sending the child to France, to the care of her
grandmother the queen-mother, who was then
at Colombes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Henrietta Maria, however, died there on 10th
September 1669,<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c013'><sup>[271]</sup></a> to the deep grief of Madame
her daughter, to whose family her young niece
was next transferred; and she remained with
her for many months. Anne was still at St
Cloud at the time of her aunt’s sudden and
tragic death, but the small English princess
became, on this event, a somewhat inconvenient
visitor in the disorganised household of Monsieur.
She was therefore sent back to England,
after spending a considerable time in France,
a visit which was kept more or less a secret at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>home, on account of the strong prejudices which
existed in England against all French influences.
The experiment does not seem to have materially
benefited the child’s health, but at any rate
back she came. Her parents despatched Colonel
Villiers and his wife to bring home their little
daughter, and the pair accordingly embarked
at Rye for Dieppe on 2nd July, thereafter
reaching the former port on their return journey
on the 23rd of the same month, but whether
the weather was unfavourable or not, the party
did not land on English shore till the 28th.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c013'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
There is a piece of information which reads
oddly in the light of subsequent events: “Lady
Anne was presented on her departure from
France with a pair of bracelets set with great
diamonds, valued at ten thousand crowns, by
the French King.” One can fancy the child
bridling over her magnificent ornaments, and
thinking how kind and splendid was the
stately, gracious King, with the long, dark eyes
and perfect manner, who clasped them on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>her chubby wrists as if she were a woman
grown.</p>

<p class='c012'>Neither he nor any one else could have foreseen
the fierce struggle of forty years later, when
the old feud would be revived, when the armies
of each were to be face to face on many a
stricken field, when Blenheim and Malplaquet
and Ramilies were to bear a bitter significance
in French ears, and when the splendid Roi Soleil
of these early days of glory would perforce veil
his lofty crest before the stubborn, invincible
troops of the little stolid English cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in the August following Madame’s
aforesaid visit to England that the Duchess of
York wrote the paper setting forth the reasons
for her change of faith which has been previously
given, but already it appears that her health
was declining. She had never really recovered from
the birth of her son Edgar,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c013'><sup>[273]</sup></a> as far back as 1667,
and she gradually became the victim of a complication
of disorders. Probably the unwieldy
size of which her contemporaries speak was
merely one symptom of failing health, as she
was only thirty-three. But the malady to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>which she finally succumbed was the terrible
scourge of cancer, which strangely enough was
destined many years later to carry off her
successor, Mary of Modena.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c013'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

“A long decay of health came to a quicker crisis. All on a
sudden she fell in agony of death.” Some time during this
year James himself was seriously ill.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>All through the autumn months of 1670 and
the succeeding winter she was ailing, often
seriously, but her indomitable will upheld her to
the very end. She was, there is no doubt, brave
and resolute, and through her “long decay
of nature” she contained herself with silent
courage, for she was never given to confide in
those about her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Early in the winter a general suspicion of her
new religious opinions began to be circulated.
She rejected the services of her chaplains<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c013'><sup>[275]</sup></a>
without, however, giving any explanation of
this conduct, further than the state of her
health “and business,” and it was in the month
of December, some months, therefore, after her
actual reception into the Roman communion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that the King spoke, as we have seen, on this
subject to the Duke of York.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Burnet says that the latter had by this time
himself seceded, though not formally, from the
Anglican Church,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c013'><sup>[276]</sup></a> before his wife did so, and
that she had “entered into discourse with his
priests.” But who these could be is not apparent,
and the story is improbable on that account.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r276'>276</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Burnet’s “History of My Own Time.” (Supplement.)
“He [the Duke of York] was bred to believe a mysterious
sort of Real Presence in the Sacrament so that he thought
he made no great step when he believed Transubstantiation,
and there was infused in him very early a great reverence for
the Church and a great submission to it; this was done on
design to possess him with prejudice against Presbytery.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>And so we come to the last act of a brief
drama, when the curtain was to ring down for
good. Much had been woven into that fabric,
the warp of sorrow and the woof of joy, but the
gilded strands were parting asunder now, and
there would be no knitting together of them any
more.</p>

<p class='c012'>The autumn after Madame’s untimely death
passed over, and in the midst of the growing
rumours that the Duchess of York was tending
towards Rome, there arose another whisper
to the effect that her bodily state was daily
growing more and more precarious. Margaret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Blagge, as we know, waited on her with tender
and unswerving devotion, sorrowfully recognising
the lonely and forlorn condition of the
proud princess who had achieved so much—and
so little.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c013'><sup>[277]</sup></a> Still, to their chagrin, the chaplains
were held at arm’s length by Morley’s
once docile and obedient pupil, and the Court
wondered and discussed the question with
growing relish and excitement.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c013'><sup>[278]</sup></a> Christmas
came and went, but for one at least there could
have been little question of the revelry belonging
to the season. The month of March drew on to
its close, and Anne must have been feeling at
any rate somewhat better, for on the 30th we
find her dining at Lord Burlington’s house in
Piccadilly and enjoying the good cheer there
provided for her (poor Anne!), for she “dined
heartily,” but after her return home she was
taken suddenly and alarmingly ill. It is possible,
from the contemporary evidence, that
the immediate attack was some form of internal
inflammation, but at any rate the gravity of the
situation was at once realised.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c013'><sup>[279]</sup></a> She had spent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>as was her custom, some three-quarters of an
hour “att her own accustomed devotions,” but
in this extremity it seems that she did call for
her chaplain, Dr Turner. After a night of agony
her director, Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, to
whose spiritual care Morley on his own retirement
had committed her, was also sent for, but
of what really took place during the next few
hours the accounts given present many discrepancies.
Over from Whitehall came Queen
Catherine, timid, gentle and compassionate, and
Burnet declares that as she arrived before the
bishop, and would not leave the sick room, the
latter lacked sufficient courage and presence of
mind to begin prayers, and only “spoke little
and fearfully.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In the ante-room without, the Duke of York
had awaited the bishop, and there alone with
him confided to his ears the secret so long concealed.
His wife, he said, had been reconciled
to the Church of Rome, and had entreated of
him, that if any bishops should come to her in
her extremity, they would not disturb her with
controversy.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c013'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Blandford can scarcely have been surprised
at the announcement, considering the surmises
which had for so long been afloat, and the
manner in which he himself and his colleagues
had been kept at a distance, but he collected
himself to answer gravely and compassionately.
He said that he believed the Duchess, in spite
of what had occurred, to be in the fair way of
salvation, seeing she had not changed her
religion for any hope of worldly gain nor advantage,
but from honest conviction. After
these words, with the Duke’s permission, the
bishop passed quietly into the stately, beautiful
room, where amid the pomp of royalty, with
brocaded curtains round her bed, the flicker of
wax lights in silver sconces only throwing the
figures of the Gobelin hangings on the walls into
darker relief, lay Duchess Anne. By her side
sat Catherine the Queen, the golden beads of her
rosary slipping one by one through her shaking
fingers, tears slowly stealing down her cheeks.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c013'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
Beyond stood Lady Cranmer, and leaning over
the dying woman, ready with the draught for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>fevered lips, was Margaret Blagge, her beautiful
face alight with infinite love and pity. Bishop
Blandford drew near, and stood for a moment
silent. Then as Anne’s dark eyes, unclosing,
met his, he said gently but distinctly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope you continue still in truth?”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>Possibly only the one word reached her failing
senses, but she answered brokenly with Pilate’s
question:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is truth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And then,” so the chronicle continues,
“her agony increasing, she repeated the word
‘Truth, truth, truth’ often.”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c013'><sup>[282]</sup></a> In that wild
March morning, when the wind beat and
clamoured round the ancient palace of the kings,
those hoarse whispers fell awfully on the ears of
the watchers, though most likely she herself
was unconscious of them. Of her own kindred
only her younger brother, Lord Rochester, came
to bid her his last farewell, refusing to believe
in her change of faith, but the elder, Cornbury,
unable to forgive her apostasy, remained away.
Of her sister Frances there is at this time no
record.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f282'>
<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r282'>282</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Burnet further says that the Queen stayed in the room
of the Duchess to prevent the prayers of the Church of
England being read, but this is improbable.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>But she who lay there was past all such things
now, and the presence or absence of kinsfolk
was alike of little matter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Blandford “made her a short Christian exhortation
suitable to the condition she was in,
and so departed.”<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c013'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps she received the last rites of Rome

but even this is uncertain.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c013'><sup>[284]</sup></a> Another authority

<p class='c012'>Out of consideration for the King’s wishes,
and in deference to public opinion, the Duke of
York, to whom it is impossible to deny some
amount of sympathy in this supreme moment,
and the difficult part he had to play, sent for
the Bishop of Oxford, though by the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the latter arrived, the Duchess was already
unconscious.</p>

<p class='c012'>But in the interval there had been a last
appeal, not indeed of controversy, but of human
affection, a spark from the fading embers of the
old, half extinguished fire, the love which had
dared and risked so much in other days. From
the ante-room where throughout those dark
hours he had perforce to interview one and
another, English bishop and Roman priest,
courtier and emissary of state, to answer inquiry,
to dictate fitting replies, James came
quietly in once more, and mounting the dais,
stood looking down on the face which had once—yes,
once—been so dear to him, the face for
which he had braved his mother’s wrath, his
brother’s arguments, the scorn of his followers.
Anne’s eyes were closed, the long dark tresses
tangled over the laced pillow. The world was
slipping silently away, or rather it was she who
was drifting out upon the waves of death.
The long-drawn breaths were growing fainter.
A great longing came over him, a longing for
at least a final recognition—a word, a look.
He stooped over her, and spoke in hushed,
unsteady accents from dry lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dame, doe ye knowe me?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>There was no reply at once, and he repeated
the appeal more than once before, seemingly,
it reached the deafened ears and failing comprehension.
At last she collected herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>With much strivings she said faintly “Aye.”
After a little respite she took a little courage,
and with what vehemency and tenderness she
could, she said: “Duke, Duke, death is terrible—death
is very terrible!”<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c013'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='label'><a href='#r286'>286</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Verney Memoirs.” Dr Denton to Sir Ralph Verney:
“By ye best and truest intelligence she did not dy a Papalina,
but she made no profession or confession either way.”
<i>Cf.</i> “Sir John Reresby: Memoirs,” ed. 1734: “This day
dyed Anne, Duchess of York, with her last breath declaring
herself a Papist.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>The voice, so greatly beloved in the past, if
not in the present, had for the moment summoned
her back, but if it was only to utter
those last most pitiful words, it surely had
been better speechless. The breathing grew
shorter—stopped.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then silence—and so vanished away Anne
Hyde.</p>

<p class='c012'>Margaret Blagge, who as we know had nursed
her “with extraordinary sedulity” and had
stood by her to the last, has set down this
sorrowful, awestruck record: “The Duchess
dead, a princess honoured in power, had much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>witt, much money, much esteeme. She was
full of unspeakable torture, and died (poore
creature) in doubt of her religion, without the
Sacrament or divine by her side, like a poore
wretch. None remembered her after one weeke,
none sorry for her; she was tost and flung about
and every one did what they would with that
stately carcase.”<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c013'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

E. W. Harcourt, 1888.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>This irreverent and revolting neglect must be
ascribed to the ill conduct of the servants and
apothecaries, who according to custom were
responsible. Neither the Duke himself nor the
ladies of the Duchess can be blamed, for they
would at once have left the room.</p>

<p class='c012'>The foregoing testimony, by the way, would
seem to establish the fact that Anne did not
receive the consolations of religion from any
priest; and for the rest, Margaret’s words “none
sorry for her” are borne out by those of Burnet,
who says she “died little beloved. Haughtiness
gained many enemies” and her “change of
religion made her friends think her death a
blessing at that time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a dreary epitaph to place on the tomb
of Anne, Duchess of York. Alas for her! The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>goodly fruit which her aspiring hand had plucked
so eagerly had long ago turned to ashes in her
very grasp, and she had drained to the utmost
dregs the cup of disillusion. And thus we leave
her, as all must be left, to the infinite mercy of
God.</p>

<p class='c012'>She died on Friday, 31st March 1671, in the
thirty-fourth year of her age. On the Sunday
following, her body, being embalmed, was
privately buried in the vault of Mary Queen of
Scots, in Henry the Seventh’s Chapel of Westminster
Abbey.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c013'><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Her little son Edgar, Duke of Cambridge, the
last of her boys, followed her on the 8th of June
succeeding, and thus of her eight children only
Mary and Anne, both destined to be successively
Queens of England, survived their childhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the memoirs of his own life, written years
subsequently, James II. paid a full and generous
tribute of respect to the memory of his first
wife, though, as we have seen, the early, passionate,
imperious love had so soon died out.</p>

<p class='c012'>Long afterwards, in the grey, weary days of
exile at St Germain, when there remained to him
only the luckless heir to a vanished inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and the winsome child Louisa, whom he called
with such sad significance his “douce consolatrice,”
the thoughts of the banished King
must sometimes at least have travelled back
to the storied past, to the days of his strenuous
if stormy youth, to his English wife, to the fair
little brood of children, of whom but two lived
on to become the Goneril and Regan of this
later Lear.</p>

<p class='c012'>When his time came, and he, too, lay down
to die in the hunting palace of King Louis, the
last Stuart king was laid to his rest, unburied,
in the Church of the English Benedictines in
Paris, in the vain, pathetic hope that some day
he might yet repose among his kindred in the
England he loved so well.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the mad upheaval of the French Revolution
ninety years later, his bones, like those of
the great lines of Valois and Bourbon, were cast
out in dishonour, and no man knows the place
of his sepulture; but Nan Hyde sleeps undisturbed
in Westminster, among the kings to
whose company the passion of a prince had
raised her.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
